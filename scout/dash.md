## Executive Summary

Scout's multi-source analysis of market conditions indicates **cautiously bullish positioning** with controlled risk. Government shutdown resolution emerges as the key near-term catalyst, unlocking delayed economic data and enabling the "Santa Claus rally" narrative. However, policy uncertainty and upcoming CPI data create meaningful downside risks.

**Recommended Strategy:** Initiate small long positions (50-75% allocation) with staged re-entry framework and tight stop losses (6% drawdown).

## 🎬 Actionable Recommendations

### Position Sizing Framework
**Current Recommendation:** Small long positions (50-75% of full allocation)

| Allocation | Market Condition | Action |

| **100%** | CPI confirms disinflation | Scale up on strength |
