Ideas for system




Consider adding a sentiment/emotion tracker to journal entries (e.g., "Emotional State: Calm / Anxious / FOMO")
Weekly summary generator - Auto-generate weekly performance summaries
Trade pattern analyzer - Analyze historical trades to identify common mistakes/wins
Screenshot integration - Add ability to link chart screenshots to journal entries

This will take into account all relavent levels and indicator data and give recommendation for ticker

whatever else is relevant to make a high probability trade trigger system
    indicator
        Moving averages
        Volatility
        Squeezes
        yearly Weekly, monthyl, daily levels. 
        Ranges
        mid points of ranges for weekly, daily, monthly and yearly
Use AI to anlyayze context of technicals and of events of the day. news, etc.
When we get a high probabity trade, we take it. 




vix data

fear and greed mixed in with the sentiment

add in presidential cycle analysis as well as other cycles

Have the AI give you scans for ToS

Integrate real time level tracking script

SPY QQQ BTC ETH SOL SUI DOGE HYPE ASTER

memories section for the AI so it can save things for itself later and things it wants to remember about me or what we do

section for to jsut simply display the overview and over all thesis

bitcoin funding rates, liquidations, open interest and what that data means

a tab that gives a concise investment and trading thesis. Prefered tickers and more. 

add a crypto twitter thing so that memes and stuff are added and considered

daily trading report that can be updated through the with levels, sentiment, news and whatever else. Have claude do research for best?

assign weighting to news sources, youtube channels, twitter accounts, etc. 





Have claude run through and offload any work it can. Like the summaries for example. . I can like run the scraper, have gemini do the summaries, then claude comes through to read all the summary overviews and updates research.html and masterplan
Also, move the trend analysis to the scraper. It can scrape and collect all that
move the trends script into the scraper with a modular script
at the end of collection, have instructions for an AI ( gemini ) to go through the data and prepare it for claude.
Can move the web searches to API, MCp or just GEMINI

    📈 Top 3 Trade Recommendations Engine – System Concept

Objective:
Build a system that delivers 3 high-probability trade ideas daily across stocks, options, or crypto, including direction (long/short), entry criteria, and optional strategy (e.g., naked call, debit spread, spot crypto, etc.).

🧠 Core Concept

Each day, the engine will:

Analyze all tradable assets across supported classes (stocks, options, crypto).

Filter for edge-based setups, using technical, fundamental, and cycle-based inputs.

Score and rank each candidate by edge strength, risk/reward, and relevance.

Output top 3 actionable trades, each with a detailed strategy.

🧰 Inputs & Analysis Layers
✅ Universal Criteria (applied across all asset classes)
Layer	Description
🔁 Trend Alignment	Multi-timeframe EMA/VWAP analysis
📊 Relative Volume (RVOL)	Unusual volume as proxy for institutional interest
🔥 Volatility Zones	ATR-based extremes, Bollinger Band squeeze/pop
🧠 Sentiment/Flow	Social signals (e.g., Stocktwits), options flow, crypto funding rates
🕰️ Cycle/Seasonality	Presidential cycle, week/month seasonality, earnings season
🧩 Catalyst	Earnings, FDA, legislation, macro (FOMC, CPI), or narrative momentum
📦 Asset-Specific Filters
Stocks

Liquidity: Price > $5, Avg Volume > 1M

Catalysts: Earnings, analyst upgrades, sector momentum

Indicators: VWAP reclaim, breakout structures, relative strength to SPY/QQQ

Options

Premium viability: Sufficient IV & OI

Setup compatibility: Is this best for spreads, naked, covered?

Greeks analysis: Focus on delta 0.3–0.5 for directional plays

Crypto

Chain signals: Funding rate, long/short ratio, open interest

Correlation with macro: BTC/SPX correlation trend

Breakouts & traps: Market structure flips, RSI/MACD shifts

📤 Output Format (per trade)
### 🥇 Trade Idea #1 – LONG $TSLA (Options: Call Debit Spread)

**Type**: Stock/Options  
**Setup**: Inside day breakout + VWAP reclaim + High RVOL  
**Strategy**: Buy 1x $TSLA $240c / Sell 1x $250c (Next Week Exp)  
**R/R**: 1.8:1  
**Catalyst**: EV sector momentum + Morgan Stanley upgrade  
**Cycle Fit**: Week 2 of month (historically strong for large-cap growth)

🔁 System Refresh
Time	Action
Pre-Market (5–6 AM PST)	Scan all markets, generate signals
Daily Output	Ranked top 3 trades posted to dashboard
Weekly Review	Backtest recent results, refine filters & weights
💡 Future Enhancements

Add GPT-based narrative scoring from headlines/Reddit

Integrate news catalysts from FinancialJuice/Feedly

Add watchlist prioritization (user-selected tickers)

Enable backtest mode (simulate past X days’ signals)

Want me to export this as a Markdown file next? Or would you like to sketch out the scoring system logic first?

You said:
Oh, I just had another idea. We could do a Top 3 for Day Trades and Top 3 for Swing Trades.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s expand the structure to support two distinct recommendation streams: one for day trades and one for swing trades.

Here’s the revised concept with both integrated:

📊 Dual-Stream Trade Recommendations Engine

Purpose:
Each trading day, output two curated Top 3 lists:

🕒 Day Trades – Short-term intraday setups for fast execution and exits

🕰️ Swing Trades – Multi-day to multi-week high-probability plays

Each trade idea includes entry logic, trade type (stock, options, crypto), strategy recommendation, risk/reward, and catalyst context.

🧠 Core Logic Flow

    Day --> Top3Day[Top 3 Day Trades]
    Swing --> Top3Swing[Top 3 Swing Trades]
    Top3Day --> Output[Generate Daily Dashboard]
    Top3Swing --> Output

🕒 Top 3 – Day Trades
Goals

Quick setups with high intraday probability

Focused on RVOL, VWAP, gap-ups, news catalysts

Hold time: minutes to hours

Filters & Signals
Signal	Description
📈 Premarket Gappers	Stocks or tokens with >1–2% move in premarket
🔁 VWAP Reclaims	Clean reclaims or rejections intraday
🔥 RVOL > 1.5	Strong intraday momentum
⏱️ Time-of-day triggers	Opening range breakout, 10:30 reversal, etc.
⚖️ ATR Zones	Target > 1R potential by 11:30am
🧃 Liquidity Filters	Stock >$5, Avg vol >1M, Crypto with depth
🚀 Options Flow	Unusual activity or short-dated IV spikes (optional)
🕰️ Top 3 – Swing Trades
Goals

High-probability setups with 1–15 day hold

Focused on trend continuation, breakouts, or reversals

Optional: Options strategy (debit spread, naked, LEAPS, etc.)

Filters & Signals
Signal	Description
🔁 Multi-Timeframe Trend	20/50/200 EMA aligned bullish/bearish
⛳ Pullback Entry	Back to rising support, trendline, Fib zone
🚨 Catalyst Window	Earnings (past or upcoming), news cycle
🔥 Momentum Scans	Relative strength vs sector/index (RSI, % above VWAP)
🧩 Macro/Cycle Fit	Fit with seasonality, sector rotation, VIX trend
📤 Example Output (Markdown Format)
## 🕒 Top 3 Day Trades – October 25, 2025

### 1. LONG $NVDA (Stock)
- **Setup**: VWAP reclaim + High RVOL + Semiconductor sector lead
- **Entry**: $417.20 (VWAP reclaim)
- **Stop**: $414.80 (1R)
- **Target**: $423.60
- **Catalyst**: AI chip flow + TSLA earnings read-through
---

## 🕰️ Top 3 Swing Trades – October 25, 2025

### 1. SHORT $COIN (Options: Put Debit Spread)
- **Setup**: Bearish engulfing after failed breakout + Crypto weakness
- **Entry**: Buy $70p, Sell $65p (Nov expiry)
- **Cost**: $2.10, Max Value: $5.00
- **Catalyst**: BTC funding rates flipped negative + SPY resistance
- **Cycle Fit**: Week after major altcoin unlock (risk-off rotation)
---

🔁 System Cycle
Time	Action
4:30–5:30am PST	Pull data (price, volume, RVOL, VWAP, news, etc.)
5:30am	Score and rank both day & swing signals
6:00am	Output Top 3 of each to dashboard/feed
EOD	Log performance, missed trades, refine models
🔮 Future Additions

GPT-based narrative builder per idea

Backtest module (simulate daily runs on past 6–12 months)

Alerts feed (webhook or Telegram push)

“Bias override” flag (macro risk-on/off override)

Real-time market news integration (e.g., FinancialJuice, Benzinga)

Would you like me to export this now to a Markdown file? Or should we design the scoring logic system for how each trade gets ranked first?
