# Earnings-Season High-Probability Playbook
_Last updated: 2025-10-28_

## Quick Filters (Use before any trade)
- **Liquidity**: ≥ $2B market cap, ADV ≥ $50M, options OI ≥ 5k total, spreads ≤ 5% of premium.
- **Event Date Known**: Confirm earnings date/time (AMC/BMO). Avoid “TBD.”
- **Catalyst Stack**: Guidance policy (habitual guider?), sector peers clustered this week, macro events.
- **Volatility Setup**: 30d IV Rank/Percentile, front-week IV vs back-month (term structure), skew shape.
- **Historical Behavior**: Last 8 quarters: gap size (avg/median), realized vs implied move, drift days.
- **Peer Linkages**: First announcer in industry? (sympathy trades day +1/+2).

## Setups & Tactics

### A) Pre-Earnings (D-10 → D-1)
**Goal:** Harvest IV run-up or position for outsized move when implied is cheap.

1) **Calendar (long back-month, short front-week)**
   - **Edge:** Front-week IV > back-month IV +10–20 pts; stable trend; no binary guidance risk leak.
   - **Entry:** D-7 to D-3 when IV term steepens.
   - **Exit:** Before announcement (theta/vega harvest).

2) **Wide Iron Condor (premium sale)**
   - **Edge:** Options imply move > 1.3× 8-Q realized move; high IV percentile; neutral skew.
   - **Entry:** D-3 to D-1; set wings beyond 1.5–2.0× expected move.
   - **Exit:** Buy back at 50–70% max profit pre-print or risk-off if IV keeps rising.

3) **Directional Stock + Put (collar optional)**
   - **Edge:** Strong trend into print with high revision breadth; use small deltas + protective puts.
   - **Exit:** Before close on announcement day.

### B) Earnings Night / Gap (Hold Through Print: **Advanced**)
**Binary risk; deploy only with proven edge.**

4) **Long Straddle/Strangle (when implied is cheap)**
   - **Edge:** Implied move < 0.8–0.9× 8-Q realized; fat-tail sectors (biotech, small-cap tech).
   - **Risk:** IV crush if move underwhelms; size ≤ 0.25R. 
   - **Exit:** Night-of or open D+0/D+1; target ≥ 30–50% if move > implied.

5) **Short Premium (when implied is dear)**
   - **Edge:** Implied move > 1.3–1.5× 8-Q realized; elevated skew; crowded fear.
   - **Structures:** Iron butterfly, ratio spreads, or covered strangle with stock.
   - **Risk:** Tail gap risk; use wings and defined loss; avoid single-product biotech.

### C) Post-Earnings Drift (D+1 → D+20)
**Exploit PEAD & guidance effects.**

6) **Drift-Long (positive surprise/guide-up)**
   - **Filters:** Gap ≥ +3%, volume ≥ 2× ADV, “triple play” (beat rev + EPS + raise guide) if possible.
   - **Entry:** First pullback that holds ≥ 38–61% of gap; reclaim of OR high.
   - **Exit:** Time-based (5–20 trading days) or loss of D1 close; trail 10-EMA.

7) **Drift-Short (negative surprise/guide-down)**
   - **Filters:** Gap ≤ −3%, volume ≥ 2× ADV, estimate dispersion high, downgrades cluster.
   - **Entry:** First bounce that fails near 38–61% retrace; OR low break.
   - **Exit:** Cover on higher low or into D+5–D+10.

8) **Sympathy & Peers**
   - **Idea:** First announcer’s news moves peers’ IV/returns. 
   - **Plays:** Long/short peer on D+1 with similar fundamentals; or long single-name gamma vs short sector ETF.

### D) Intraday Day-2 Playbook (Liquidity Only)
- **OR30 Break + High RVOL:** Go with break in surprise direction; stop = other side of OR.
- **VWAP Plays:** Buy/sell retests in trend direction; avoid chop when VWAP pinning.
- **Mean-Revert:** Only when gap exhausts by 11:30 and fails to make new extremes.

## Expected Move (EM) & Sizing
- **EM (simple):** Sum of nearest ATM call + put (same expiry). 
- **Position Sizing:** Risk ≤ 0.5–1.0% equity per idea; for overnight options, use ≤ 0.25–0.5R.
- **Portfolio:** Limit single-name earnings exposure ≤ 20% gross; diversify across sectors/dates.

## Risk Rules (Non-negotiable)
- Always **define max loss** (use wings or hard stops). 
- No holds through print without quantified EM edge & liquidity.
- Avoid illiquid weeklies (wide spreads).
- Respect macro landmines (Fed, CPI, jobs).
- Never average losers on binary gaps.

## Data You Need
- Earnings calendar, EPS & revenue surprise, guidance text, IV rank/term structure, skew, OR levels, RVOL, peer list.
- Track last 8 quarters: gap %, drift days, realized vs implied, downgrades/upgrades.

## Signals & Stats to Monitor
- **PEAD:** Positive surprises drift up for weeks; negative surprises drift down (size & persistence scale with the surprise).
- **IV Crush:** Front-week IV falls sharply post-print; premium sellers win unless move exceeds EM.
- **Guidance:** Guide-ups + “triple play” show strongest drift; guide-downs persist.

## Checklist (Pre-Trade)
- [ ] Liquidity & spreads acceptable
- [ ] Event date/time confirmed
- [ ] EM vs 8-Q realized compared
- [ ] IV term & skew checked
- [ ] Peer sympathy mapped
- [ ] Entry/exit & max loss written
