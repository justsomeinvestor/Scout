# Market Seasonality & Cycles — Quick Reference
**Generated:** 2025-10-03

This one-pager maps the most-cited market cycles, what they claim, and where the data comes from. It’s grouped into:  
(A) Stock-market seasonality, (B) U.S. presidential (4‑year) cycle, (C) business-cycle patterns, (D) policy/market‑structure cycles, and (E) crypto‑specific cycles.

---

## A) Stock‑Market Seasonality (Calendar Patterns)

- **Month‑of‑Year (S&P 500)**
  - **Claim:** Historically stronger **Nov–Apr** vs **May–Oct**; **September** is often the weakest on average; **Q4** tends to be the best quarter.  
  - **Notes:** Use as context for sizing/bias; not a standalone timing rule.

- **“Sell in May” / Halloween Effect**
  - **Claim:** Nov–Apr outperforms May–Oct across many markets/samples in historical studies. Persistence varies by era and geography.  
  - **Notes:** Combine with trend, breadth, and risk filters.

- **Santa‑Claus Rally**
  - **Window:** Last 5 trading days of Dec + first 2 trading days of Jan.  
  - **Claim:** Small positive average drift (≈1.0–1.5% historically), not guaranteed annually.  
  - **Notes:** Micro‑tactical; be careful with costs/slippage.

- **Turn‑of‑the‑Month (TOM)**
  - **Window:** Roughly the last 4 trading days of the month through the first 3 of the next.  
  - **Claim:** Higher average returns near month‑turn in many samples; attenuation reported in recent decades.  
  - **Notes:** At best a light overlay, not a core edge.

- **Day‑of‑Week / Holiday Effects**
  - **Claim:** Modest tendencies (e.g., pre‑holiday strength); weekday patterns vary by sample and often shrink after costs.  
  - **Notes:** Treat as very low‑conviction context.

## B) U.S. Presidential (4‑Year) Cycle

- **Year‑by‑Year Tendency**
  - **Claim:** **Year 3 (pre‑election year)** has historically been the strongest for equities on average; **Year 4 (election year)** tends to be positive but more “ordinary”; **Year 1** can be choppier.  
  - **Notes:** Large dispersion around the averages; don’t ignore the macro regime and policy backdrop.

- **Sector/Dispersion Nuances**
  - **Claim:** Sector performance dispersion often widens around election periods; leadership shifts are common.  
  - **Notes:** Pair with relative strength and policy‑sensitive industries.

---

## C) Business‑Cycle (Macro) Patterns

- **What It Is**
  - **Definition:** NBER dates **peaks** and **troughs** (recessions are peak→trough; expansions are trough→peak). Expansions are the “normal” state and typically last longer than recessions.

- **Why It Matters**
  - **Claim:** Equities tend to weaken heading into/within recessions and recover early in expansions; timing varies.  
  - **Notes:** Watch leading indicators (labor claims, ISM, yield curve, credit), earnings revisions, and liquidity conditions rather than fixed calendars.

---

## D) Policy & Market‑Microstructure Cycles

- **FOMC (Fed) “Pre‑Announcement Drift”**
  - **Window:** ~24 hours **before** scheduled FOMC announcements.  
  - **Claim:** Historically positive excess equity returns documented in academic/central‑bank research; magnitude/time‑variation debated in later work.  
  - **Notes:** Treat with caution; regimes change.

- **Options Expiration (Triple/Quad Witching)**
  - **When:** Third Friday of **Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec** (plus monthly & now weekly expirations).  
  - **Claim:** Volume/volatility spikes and short‑term dislocations are common; no consistent directional edge.  
  - **Notes:** Plan liquidity, slippage, and hedging.

---

## E) Crypto‑Specific Cycles (Bitcoin as Benchmark)

- **Bitcoin Halving (~Every 4 Years)**
  - **Claim:** Post‑halving periods have *often* coincided with bullish regimes, though magnitudes/timelines vary by cycle.  
  - **Notes:** Macro liquidity, adoption, and risk cycles can dominate any simple halving template.

- **Month‑of‑Year (BTC)**
  - **Claim:** Recurring month effects show up in some datasets (e.g., **September** weakness), but dispersion is very high.  
  - **Notes:** Use as a weak prior; pair with trend/volatility metrics.

- **Day‑of‑Week (Crypto)**
  - **Claim:** Some studies find weekday return/volatility differences; results differ by era and coin.  
  - **Notes:** Very low‑signal on its own.

## TL;DR Table

| Cycle / Effect | Typical Window | Claimed Tendency | Best Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Month‑of‑Year (S&P) | Calendar months | Sept weak; Q4 strongest | Context for sizing/bias |
| “Sell in May” | Nov–Apr vs May–Oct | Nov–Apr outperforms (historically) | Regime prior + trend/breadth |
| Santa‑Claus Rally | Last 5 Dec + first 2 Jan | Small positive drift | Micro‑tactical only |
| Turn‑of‑Month | ~−4 to +3 trading days | Higher avg returns | Secondary overlay |
| Presidential Cycle | Years 1–4 | Yr 3 strongest on avg | Macro risk budget prior |
| Business Cycle | Expansion/Peak/Recession/Trough | Weak into recessions; early recoveries | Lean on NBER dating + leading data |
| FOMC Drift | ~24h pre‑FOMC | Historically positive excess returns | Event‑risk framing |
| Options Expiration | 3rd Fri Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec | Volume/volatility spikes | Liquidity planning |
| BTC Halving | ~Every 4 years | Post‑halving bull bias (variable) | Crypto regime prior |
| BTC Month Seasonality | Calendar months | Sept often weak | Low‑conviction prior |
| Crypto Weekday | Weekdays | Mixed weekday effects | Low‑conviction micro‑timing |

## Practical Guidance

- Treat seasonality as **context**, not commands. Require confirmation from **trend**, **breadth**, **volatility**, and **liquidity**.
- Expect **regime shifts** (policy, inflation, credit). Backtest with realistic **frictions** (spreads, slippage, borrow costs, funding).
- Size positions so that seasonality tilts **nudge** risk/reward—don’t let them override stop/target logic.
