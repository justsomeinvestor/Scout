# NVDA Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** AI infrastructure backbone, accelerated computing, software ecosystem (CUDA + DGX Cloud).
- **Timeframe Focus:** Short-term (1-3m) supply chain checks; Medium-term (3-12m) Blackwell cycle; Long-term (12m+) inference/software monetization.
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 36/40, Technicals 20/25, Management 15/15, Risk 6/10, Sentiment 8/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **Blackwell Upgrade Cycle:** GB200/B200 slated to dominate high-end GPU shipments in 2025, improving ASP mix and data center revenue trajectory.[1]
2. **Platform Lock-In:** CUDA software moat and networking (NVLink, Spectrum-X) reinforce demand for full-stack deployments; incremental recurring revenue from DGX Cloud and Omniverse.
3. **Supply Chain Advantage:** CoWoS capacity secured via TSM and ASE, plus increasing in-house module manufacturing, moderates lead time risk relative to peers.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **GTC Europe (November 2025):** Expect deeper GB200 roadmap, automotive and robotics updates.
- **Q3 FY26 Earnings (Nov 2025):** Watch data center growth >70% y/y and sequential margin expansion.
- **Hyperscaler Capex Guides:** Azure, AWS, Google Cloud commentary on Blackwell deployment cadence.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Data center revenue mix (>78%), supply-demand balance (lead times trending 14-16 weeks), gross margin sustainability (>74%).
- Networking revenue growth (Spectrum-X attach), software ARR disclosures.

## Technical & Positioning
- Daily consolidation between - following August breakout; 21d EMA acting as support.
- Strategy: Core position with adds on pullback to  (volume-weighted support); trade rips above  for momentum. Max 5% allocation given volatility.

## Risk Factors
- Export controls tightening on high-end GPUs to China/Middle East.
- Competition from custom silicon (MSFT Maia, AMZN Trainium) could cap hyperscaler wallet share.
- Supply chain disruptions in advanced packaging or HBM supply (SK Hynix, Samsung).
