# AMD Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** AI accelerators (MI300/MI325/MI350), x86 CPUs, adaptive computing.
- **Portfolio Role:** Challenger play on AI GPU demand and hyperscaler diversification.
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 30/40, Technicals 18/25, Management 13/15, Risk 6/10, Sentiment 7/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **MI325/MI350 Ramp:** Adoption accelerating into 2025 with new hyperscaler wins, widening the AI TAM beyond Nvidia incumbency.[1]
2. **Software Ecosystem Maturation:** ROCm 6.x improvements, PyTorch integration, and partnership with Hugging Face reduce switching friction.
3. **Embedded + FPGA Synergies:** Pensando DPUs and Xilinx FPGAs provide differentiated platform for data center networking and edge inferencing.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **Advancing AI Events (Q4 2025):** Expect refreshed product roadmaps and software partnerships.
- **Q4 2025 Earnings:** Monitor DC revenue growth >40% y/y and gross margin recovery toward 53%.
- **OEM Announcements:** Track SMCI, Dell, HPE for MI300 server design wins.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- AI GPU supply commitments, MI300 family market share (target double-digit exiting 2025).
- Data center segment margin, software ecosystem adoption metrics.

## Technical & Positioning
- Stock forming higher lows above  support; breakout trigger at .
- Position 3% max; add on volume breakout with stop below .

## Risk Factors
- Execution risk on MI350 tape-out and supply vs demand alignment.
- Pricing pressure if Nvidia or custom silicon leads to margin concessions.
- Dependence on TSMC advanced nodes (5nm/4nm) for GPU production.
