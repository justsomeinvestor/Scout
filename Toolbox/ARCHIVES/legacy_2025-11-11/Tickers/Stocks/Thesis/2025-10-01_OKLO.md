# OKLO Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** Advanced nuclear microreactors, clean energy transition, DOE partnerships.
- **Portfolio Role:** Speculative/high-beta option on next-gen nuclear; size accordingly (<1% position).
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 12/40, Technicals 12/25, Management 11/15, Risk 3/10, Sentiment 5/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **DOE Support:** Selected by U.S. Department of Energy for nuclear fuel line projects, validating technology roadmap and providing funding visibility.[1]
2. **Aurora Demonstration Progress:** Work with Idaho National Laboratory advances regulatory milestones toward first-of-a-kind deployment.
3. **Strategic Partnerships:** Emerging R&D collaborations with utilities and industrial partners signal potential commercial uptake in late 2020s.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **Regulatory Filings:** NRC licensing updates; watch for site permit progress in 2026.
- **DOE Milestones:** Funding tranches tied to project deliverables over next 12-24 months.
- **Commercial MOUs:** Additional offtake agreements or strategic investments from energy majors.

## Technical & Positioning
- Thin liquidity; use limit orders only. Treat as venture-style exposure with defined capital at risk.

## Risk Factors
- Technology execution risk, regulatory delays, capital intensity.
- Public perception/political shifts affecting nuclear policy.
- Dilution risk from capital raises before commercialization.
