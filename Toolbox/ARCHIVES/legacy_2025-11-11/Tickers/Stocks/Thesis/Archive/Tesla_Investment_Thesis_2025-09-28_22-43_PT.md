# Tesla Investment Thesis — **Consolidated** (v1.2)
**Last updated:** 2025-09-28 22:43 PT  
**Scope & provenance:** Unified from two prior drafts you shared; duplicates were removed, overlapping sections were merged, and structure was tightened to serve as the single “source of truth” going forward.

---

## 1) Executive Summary
**Core claim.** Tesla’s next leg is powered by three stacked flywheels: **(A) Autonomy (FSD v14 → unsupervised)**, **(B) Robo‑mobility (CyberCab + network)** built on an **unboxed 2.0** manufacturing system, and **(C) Embodied AI (Optimus)** — with traditional auto + energy funding the transition. If autonomy quality and fleet ops scale into **2026–2027**, both unit economics and narrative can inflect.

**Near‑term focus (2025):** Treat 2025 as validation/build‑out: measure the FSD v14→14.2 cadence via hard telemetry, stabilize manufacturing learnings, and prepare the mobility & robotics stack for 2026‑ramp proof points.

---

## 2) Strategic Context — AI6 & Samsung (2025–2033)
- Multi‑year **AI6** silicon program with Samsung (Taylor, TX) anchors training + inference across robotaxi, Optimus, FSD, and data‑center workloads. The publicly discussed spend was framed as a **minimum** that could scale with product ramps.  
- **Why it matters:** supply security; bargaining leverage (dual‑source vs. TSMC); tighter HW↔SW integration for mobility/robotics services.

> *Operational takeaway:* Track fab yield/throughput readiness on AI6 alongside software telemetry — both are gating items for 2026–2027 scale.

---

## 3) Pillar A — Autonomy (FSD)
**State (2025H2):** Early wide release of **v14**, with **14.1/14.2** quick follow‑ons. Expect some initial regressions vs. a year‑honed v13; focus on comfort/consistency improvements and closing edge cases (bus/bike lanes, parking lots).

**What to track (KPIs):**
- Disengagements per 1,000 miles by ODD/city; intervention taxonomy and collision‑surrogate metrics.  
- Ride comfort (lateral/longitudinal jerk) and route‑completion without nav edits.  
- ODD footprint (geos, allowed speeds/roads) and regulator‑approved **unsupervised** miles.  
- **Attach/ARPU**: FSD subscription penetration and churn.

**Milestones (target windows):**
- v14 GA breadth **Oct–Nov ’25**; 14.1/14.2 quality lifts **Nov–Dec ’25**.  
- First unsupervised pockets: upside case is limited geos with strict ODD; confirm via hard data before underwriting.

---

## 4) Pillar B — Robo‑mobility (CyberCab + Network)
**Manufacturing thesis:** **Unboxed 2.0** targets **<10s cycle time** *over a learning curve*; paint‑booth deletion via **RIM panels**; fewer stations; higher output/m²; better labor/capex efficiency. Patents are open; process know‑how remains proprietary.

**SOP & ramp (working plan):**
- **SOP:** **2Q 2026** baseline; sub‑10s cycle time achieved post‑launch as yields/OEE normalize.  
- **Top risks:** RIM color consistency across substrates; top‑five launch issues; yield stabilization; tooling maturity.

**Mobility unit‑economics framework:**
- Revenue/mile × utilization (hrs/day) × occupancy − per‑mile opex (electricity, tires, cleaning, insurance, depreciation, supervision).  
- Sensitivities: price elasticity, uptime, self‑insurance, city fees/reg caps.

**KPIs:** SOP date; secs/station & line OEE; yields; capex/vehicle; cost/mile; city approvals; rides/day per vehicle.

---

## 5) Pillar C — Embodied AI (Optimus)
**What matters:** paid, useful tasks inside Tesla factories → then externalization. Base case: **hundreds** deployed **late 2026** *if* factory utility proves out. Version branding (Gen‑2/3) < MTBF, task throughput, $/BOM, safety.

**KPIs:** tasks/hour, MTBF, $/bot BOM, power draw, retraining cadence, human‑in‑the‑loop ratio, safety incidents.

---

## 6) Catalyst Calendar (initial pass; to be date‑locked with official notices)
- **Early Oct 2025:** Q3 P&D.  
- **Late Oct 2025:** Q3 earnings call.  
- **~Nov 6, 2025:** Shareholder meeting (vote confirmation; potential tech/bot updates).  
- **Oct–Dec 2025:** FSD v14→14.1/14.2 telemetry & quality.  
- **1H 2026:** New model intros & robo‑network expansion.  
- **2Q 2026:** CyberCab SOP (working date).  
- **2H 2026:** “Confirmation phase” — new programs begin to show in financials.

## 7) Consolidated KPI Dashboard (one page)
**Autonomy:** disengagements/1k mi • comfort jerk profiles • ODD coverage • unsupervised miles • FSD sub attach/churn/ARPU.  
**Robo‑mobility:** secs/station • line OEE • yields • rides/day/vehicle • cost/mile • approvals/cities online.  
**Optimus:** tasks/hour • MTBF • $/BOM • safety incidents • factory roles count • retraining cadence.  
**Chip stack (AI6):** tape‑out → bring‑up → yield ramps • throughput • power perf • cost trajectory.

> *Process note:* Keep each metric on a single sparkline with a green/yellow/red status and a brief “why” annotation.

---

## 8) Valuation Frameworks (to iterate)
**A. Core Auto + Software (’25–’27):** units × ASP × GM% + (FSD ARPU × attach) with price/mix and credit dynamics.  
**B. Mobility (DCF):** city‑by‑city ramp (vehicles, rides/day, price/mile, cost/mile, take‑rate), venture‑style risk in early years.  
**C. Energy (Megapack):** shipped GWh • ASP/kWh • learning‑curve margins • backlog.  
**D. Optimus (Real Options):** probability‑weighted options tied to factory deployment milestones.  
**E. SOTP:** sum (A–D) − net debt + cash; sanity‑check with comps (AV, energy storage, robotics).

---

## 9) Risks — single merged list
- **Execution:** FSD v14 regression persistence; CyberCab yield/ramp; **AI6** fab yield & time‑to‑maturity.  
- **Regulatory/Legal:** slower unsupervised approvals; incident‑driven pauses; city caps/fees.  
- **Demand/Macro:** EV pricing pressure; rate sensitivity; competitive autonomy/EV advances.  
- **Financial/Capital:** elevated capex for CyberCab/tooling/network; insurance; potential equity/convert issuance.  
- **Narrative/Valuation:** high sensitivity to AI timelines; media fixation on symbolic milestones vs. real KPIs.

## 10) Thesis by Horizon
| Horizon | Driver | Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| **6–12 months** | AI6 visibility, FSD v14 telemetry, P&D/earnings, meeting | Choppy tape; **prove** AI execution with numbers. |
| **1–3 years** | CyberCab ramp, early Optimus utility, AI6 production | Upside if services + chip‑enabled products scale. |
| **3–10 years** | AI‑first ecosystem (Optimus, robo‑taxis, data centers) | Platform transformation; diversified revenue beyond auto. |

---

## 11) Trading Posture (for discussion, not advice)
- **Into P&D/earnings:** elevated IV → favor defined‑risk structures; wait for guide/telemetry.  
- **Software cadence:** treat 14.0→14.2 as data‑gathering windows; prioritize quantified KPIs over adjectives.  
- **Meeting day (~Nov 6):** beware assuming product theater; focus on numeric roadmaps.

---

## 12) Changelog
- **v1.2 (this file):** Consolidated the two prior drafts; removed redundancy; surfaced AI6 as a first‑class strategic pillar; added unified KPI dashboard and risks.  
- **v1.1:** First integrated draft emphasizing AI6/Samsung context and merged risks/horizon table.  
- **v1.0:** Transcript‑anchored working draft; initial KPIs and catalyst calendar.
