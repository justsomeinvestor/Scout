# TSLA Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** EV leadership, AI autonomous stack, energy storage scale-up.
- **Portfolio Role:** Core transition exposure with optionality on autonomy and energy storage.
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 28/40, Technicals 17/25, Management 13/15, Risk 5/10, Sentiment 6/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **Deliveries Inflection:** Q3 deliveries set for boost from expiring U.S. EV credit and resilient China registrations, easing near-term volume fears.[1]
2. **FSD v14 Rollout:** Step-change in supervised autonomy could unlock higher attach rates, enhancing software margin contribution.
3. **Energy Storage Momentum:** Megapack backlog and margins continue to expand; IRA incentives sustain U.S. deployments into 2026.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **Q3 Delivery Print (Oct 2, 2025):** Key sentiment driver; monitor ASP and mix shifts.
- **AI Day / FSD Updates (Q4 2025):** Evidence of autonomy progress and potential licensing discussion.
- **Energy Investor Day (1H26):** Focus on grid-scale storage and virtual power plant (VPP) expansion.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Automotive gross margin ex-credits (>18%), FSD take rate (>25% of U.S. deliveries), energy storage deployments (>20 GWh annualized).
- China weekly registrations, Cybertruck ramp efficiency, AI training compute spend.

## Technical & Positioning
- Support at  (50d EMA) and  (200d SMA); resistance near .
- Accumulate on pullbacks toward  with stop below ; max exposure 4% due to volatility.

## Risk Factors
- Price cuts pressuring margin if demand softens post-credit expiration.
- Autonomy regulatory hurdles or safety incidents delaying FSD monetization.
- Rising competition in China (BYD, Li Auto) and macro sensitivity to rates.
