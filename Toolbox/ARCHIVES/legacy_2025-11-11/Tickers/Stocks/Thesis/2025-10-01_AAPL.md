# AAPL Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** Consumer AI + Services flywheel, Vision Pro ecosystem, silicon vertical integration.
- **Primary Timeframes:** Medium-term (3-12m) services acceleration; Long-term (12m+) device + AI platform convergence.
- **Scorecard Emphasis:** Fundamentals 32/40, Technicals 18/25, Management 14/15, Risk 7/10, Sentiment 7/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **Services Mix Shift:** App Store, licensing, and advertising now >28% of revenue with 45% gross margins; Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence create new subscription bundles and attach opportunity.
2. **On-Device AI Differentiation:** In-house Neural Engine roadmap (A19/M5) prioritizes privacy-preserving models and reduces dependence on hyperscaler AI APIs, supporting premium ASPs.
3. **Emerging Hardware Catalysts:** Foldable roadmap (late 2025) and refreshed MacBook AI silicon keep unit growth modest but stable; replacement cycle trough appears to be behind with FY25 iPhone volumes stabilizing.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **Q4 FY25 Earnings (Nov 2025):** Monitor services gross margin expansion and Apple Intelligence engagement metrics.
- **Spring 2026 Product Line:** M5-based Macs and potential foldable iPhone introduction.
- **Regulatory Updates:** EU DMA compliance progress on sideloading; track impact on services take-rate.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Services revenue growth >12% y/y, attach rates for Vision Pro productivity bundles, Device install base (currently ~2.3B).
- Gross margin trend (target maintaining 44%+), share of revenue from AI-enabled devices.

## Technical & Positioning
- **Structure:** Weekly uptrend intact with support near 50-week SMA; relative strength vs QQQ improving since mid-September.
- **Execution:** Accumulate on pullbacks to - (50d EMA), with add-on above  breakout. Position sizing max 4% portfolio.

## Risk Factors
- China demand elasticity to premium pricing and regulatory pressure on iPhone usage.
- Services regulation (app store fees, advertising disclosure) could compress high-margin segment.
- Supply-chain concentration in advanced packaging partners (TSMC, ASE) for Apple Silicon.

## Quick Notes
- Maintain channel checks on Vision Pro enterprise pilots (design, health, training verticals).
- Track Apple Intelligence feature adoption once iOS 19 adoption surpasses 60% of base.
