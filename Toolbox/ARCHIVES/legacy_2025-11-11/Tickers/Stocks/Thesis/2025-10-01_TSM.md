# TSM Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** Leading-edge foundry, advanced packaging (CoWoS, SoIC), AI supply chain enabler.
- **Portfolio Role:** Strategic supplier exposure to AI GPU/accelerator boom.
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 34/40, Technicals 17/25, Management 14/15, Risk 6/10, Sentiment 7/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **Advanced Packaging Scale:** Aggressive CoWoS capacity expansion through 2025 addresses AI accelerator bottleneck and drives ASP uplift.[1]
2. **Node Leadership:** N2 and N2P nodes entering risk production late 2025; High-NA EUV readiness ensures continued process leadership.
3. **Regional Diversification:** Arizona and Kumamoto fabs improve geopolitical resilience and secure subsidies, albeit with initial margin drag.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **October 2025 Earnings:** Look for guidance on CoWoS utilization (>85%) and N3 revenue mix (>15%).
- **CoWoS Capacity Updates:** Industry checks on tripling capacity by mid-2026.
- **Geopolitical Developments:** Monitor cross-strait tensions and U.S. export rules.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Capacity utilization, capex guidance (>USD 32B FY25), gross margin trend (target 53%+), AI revenue mix.

## Technical & Positioning
- Shares consolidating near ; 200d SMA at  is key support.
- Build core 3% position; add on break of  with volume.

## Risk Factors
- Geopolitical risk in Taiwan Strait, supply chain shocks.
- Margin pressure from overseas fabs and customer price negotiations.
- Dependency on a handful of mega-customers (AAPL, NVDA, AMD) for leading-node demand.
