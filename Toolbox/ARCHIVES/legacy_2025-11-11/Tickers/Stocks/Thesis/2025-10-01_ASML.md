# ASML Investment Thesis (Updated 2025-10-01)

## Snapshot
- **Theme Alignment:** Lithography monopoly (EUV/High-NA), enabling sub-2nm semiconductor roadmap.
- **Portfolio Role:** Critical equipment supplier with long-dated secular demand.
- **Scorecard:** Fundamentals 35/40, Technicals 18/25, Management 14/15, Risk 6/10, Sentiment 7/10.

## Thesis Pillars
1. **High-NA EUV Ramp:** First systems shipping in 2025 underpin sub-2nm plans at Intel/TSMC/Samsung, extending ASML's technology lead.[1]
2. **Service & Installed Base Growth:** High-NA adds to lucrative service contracts; installed base management contributes >30% of revenue with high margins.
3. **Structural Pricing Power:** Scarcity of EUV tools and multi-year order book provide visibility and pricing resilience.

## Catalysts & Timeline
- **Q3 2025 Earnings (Oct):** Focus on High-NA booking cadence and normalized China revenue mix post export controls.
- **Customer Node Transitions:** Monitor Intel 18A/14A, TSM N2 adoption status.
- **Policy Watch:** Netherlands/U.S. export licensing changes.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Backlog (>€35B), gross margin (>52%), service revenue growth, High-NA tools shipped vs planned (=10 in FY25).

## Technical & Positioning
- Stock rebounded above 50d EMA; resistance at €850.
- Accumulate on pullbacks toward €780; position 3% max, hedge with EUR exposure if needed.

## Risk Factors
- Export restrictions to China reducing DUV shipments.
- Execution risk on High-NA installation schedules.
- Macro capex slowdown if memory recovery stalls.
