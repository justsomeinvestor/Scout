# Solana Investment Thesis (as of Oct 18, 2025)

## 1) Core Idea
Solana aims to be the default high-throughput, low-latency settlement layer for *consumer* and *exchange-like* on-chain activity (payments, DEX trading, perps, NFTs, DePIN), while steadily improving resilience (multi-client), validator economics, and institutional access. The bet is that real usage (transactions + active users) and growing validator revenues eventually translate into durable protocol revenues and value accrual to SOL via fee burns, staking yields, and broader capital-market rails (futures/ETFs).

## 2) Revenue & Unit Economics

- **Fees & chain revenue (current run-rate snapshots):**  
  • Fees collected (24h): **$740k**  
  • Protocol *revenue* (24h): **$134k**  
  • Active addresses (24h): **~2.06M**  
  • Transactions (24h): **~57.8M**  
  • DEX volume (24h): **$4.06B**; Perps volume (24h): **$1.25B**  

- **Validator economics:**  
  Priority fees now go **100% to validators** (SIMD-0096), and REV has surged (e.g., all-time high ~$56.9M on Jan 19, 2025; recent quarter avg ~**$800M**).

- **Fee burn split:** **50% of base transaction fees are burned**, remainder goes to validators.

**Interpretation:** Solana’s *user-driven* throughput translates to large DEX/perps volumes and many small payments—most fee value flows to validators (healthy security), while burns modestly offset inflation for holders.

---

## 3) Monetary Policy & Inflation

- **Schedule:** Initial inflation **8%**, decays **15%/yr** to a terminal **1.5%**. Current reported inflation **~4.23%**.  
- **Burn:** 50% of each base fee is burned.

**Interpretation:** Net supply growth trends down over time; higher on-chain activity + burns increase the chance of neutral/deflationary episodes during peak usage.

---

## 4) Staking, Validators & Decentralization

- **Staking ratio:** **~67%** of total supply staked (≈**410M SOL**). Typical APY ranges **5.5–7.5%**.  
- **Validator set:** **~1,295** consensus validators, **Nakamoto coefficient = 20**.  
- **Multi-client progress:** **Firedancer** (Jump Crypto) now live with ~34 validators (~7%).

**Interpretation:** High staking participation, improving validator economics, and multi-client progress reduce single-client risk and enhance reliability.

---

## 5) Users & What They’re Doing

- **Usage snapshots:** **~2.06M active addresses**, **~57.8M transactions** (24h).  
- **Trading:** Solana dominates on-chain trading and perps volume.  
- **Stablecoins & payments:** Deep integration with **USDC** and used by **Visa** for on-chain settlement.  
- **DePIN / consumer apps:** **Helium**, **Hivemapper**, **Render** all building on Solana.  
- **Institutional rails:** **R3 partnership** (HSBC, BoA, Euroclear, MAS); **CME SOL futures** expected.

**Interpretation:** Solana captures real throughput: stablecoins, DEXes, DePIN, and tokenized assets.

---

## 6) Technology & Roadmap

- **Performance:** Firedancer targets 1M TPS and enhanced reliability.  
- **Network health:** Dramatic improvements in success rates and transaction reliability since 2024.

---

## 7) Valuation Framework

- **Top-line metrics:** fees, protocol revenue, DEX/perps volume, tx count, active addresses.  
- **Validator/holder accrual:** Separate validator REV vs protocol revenue and burn.  
- **Monetary dynamics:** Inflation ~4.23%, offset by burns.

---

## 8) Key Risks

- **Reliability/outages:** Last major outage Feb 2024; small 2025 disruptions observed.  
- **Validator concentration/MEV:** Ongoing monitoring needed.  
- **Regulation:** Futures/ETF path and stablecoin legislation could sway flows.  
- **Competition:** Ethereum L2s, other L1s compete for devs/liquidity.

---

## 9) Bull vs Bear Triggers

- **Bear:** Reliability stalls, user base shrinks, validator economics weaken.  
- **Bull:** Firedancer success, CME futures + ETF approval, sustained trading/payment leadership.

---

## 10) Key Dashboards to Track

- **DefiLlama:** Fees, revenue, DEX/perps volume, active users.  
- **Solana Foundation Network Health:** Validator stats, REV.  
- **Solana Compass Tokenomics:** Inflation, staking %.  
- **Token Terminal:** Fees/revenue time series.  
- **Visa Solana Report:** Payments fit.  
- **Reuters / FT:** CME futures, R3 news.

### Summary

Solana’s combination of heavy usage, validator-friendly economics, improving reliability, and institutional adoption potential makes it one of the most fundamentally active L1 ecosystems. The thesis hinges on continued **reliability improvements**, **usage growth**, and **institutional on-ramps** like CME and R3.
