Good morning everyone

TSLA European numbers were better

Andy-- SPX today?



Daryll
6:30 am
Could be honestly. Reddit sentiment is in the toliet. People love to jump to new social sites, to run from learning that the sites arent the problem, people are. So Sora could turn into something hot, especially since sam see's this as a way to attack something elon loves. Look at bluesky, everyone "left" ran there as a bastion, reddit too. So i think " the left " for lack of a better term, is seeking a new powerful social media platform to compete 1 to 1 with X.

So maybe that is why RDDT getting hit?

fetersynergy
6:40 am
Daryll the inside stuff Sam-Musk is a concept of business.  Today Musk is demonizing NFLX.   Let's be clear.  That has zero to do with stocks and how they price


NVDA stuck at support 


AAPL support 256.84 to 257


As I have been stating for days AAPL 261



mark7
6:42 am
LLY above the POC trying to capture the 200 day



fetersynergy
6:42 am
LLY is 808


best guess wave 3 = 794-795 then wave 5 808


Have been holding ELIL a 2x's ETN LLY

M
Mostfavored100
6:47 am
Yes thanks Andy ELIL



fetersynergy
6:48 am
yeah tariffs were an overhang.   Let me be clear about LLY.  This one going back to $1,000


Best of the bunch


AAPL broke down


NVDA broke support


sorry breached support 184


If NVDA holds 184 the target is 192.75


IBIT if it can clear the previous high at 67.00+/- then the target is 68+


lots of targets up to 70.00 area



mark7
6:56 am
STX with anew high



fetersynergy
7:03 am
AAPL looks to go back to 253


NVDA is firming up.  I am in NVDL and calls for NVDA


remember this stock is 4.5T in size.  It can move markets



AP
7:05 am
good morning all


fetersynergy
7:05 am
TSLA got close to that 450.  Under 445 could be a good short back to 435


NAIL hit first resistance at 75.  See if it can get thru?


Target NAIL 78.50 but needs to clear 75

JimHden
7:20 am
Thanks for ELIL Andy.  SOUN moving up.



fetersynergy
7:20 am
Took a trade TSLL on TSLA above 450


Assuming 450 holds TSLA to 460.20 could retest 450



mark7
7:23 am
Thanks Andy, was waiting for it to move



fetersynergy
7:27 am
SPY resistance = 666 and QQQ = 600.   QQQ at resistance


TSLA went into first resistance 456

LLY was a nice trade, already hit my close orders. Thanks Andy! Also, alert on NFLX, 1160 area good to start scaling in for long term hold, right? 


S
Steveh43
7:32 am
not much option activity on ELIL???



nancil
7:33 am
Looks like NFLX could go to 1160.  Agree, Andy?



mark7

NVDA moving


new high, see if it can hold it


m
maverick21
7:40 am
Andy, any range on MARA?



BobB
7:40 am
hey Mark...NVDA...SMH strong again today and ES thru 6731 resistance...I got in NVDA calls when 185 reclaimed and held


QQQ 600



fetersynergy
7:43 am
NFLX is chopping 1150 area to 1270-1350 area



PenelopeF
7:43 am
Hummm gov shutdown doesn't seem to be affecting the market...so far...



fetersynergy
7:43 am
It never does



PenelopeF
7:44 am
That seems so weird to me, but then what do I know. LOL



fetersynergy
7:44 am
MARA needs 20.   After the last 1/2ing these have been dead money



donnabp
7:45 am
I stayed on my plan.  I remember Andy saying the shutdowns didn't really impact the market.  Thank you, Andy



fetersynergy
7:45 am
sure donna.   They will impact consumer space if it is prolonged.   Say 30-40 days or longer



PenelopeF
7:46 am
Ahhh, good to know. Thanks



mark7
7:46 am
Nice, Bob NVDA



Daryll
7:47 am
caught nvda also. 185 reclaim. 5 min early trigger



PenelopeF
7:47 am
This may be old news, but just heard a couple days ago that Tom is leaving TastyTrade. On to new adventures I guess.


m
maverick21
7:48 am
thx Andy. Andy range on DWTX?



Daryll
7:48 am
i was watching a interview and i think tom is gone or just advisor or something. He said he has something new coming ?


probably repeating what he did with think or swim



fetersynergy
7:48 am
189.85 next on NVDA


Sold 1/3 NVDA calls



Daryll
7:51 am
Pen : youtube.com/watch?v=-gp7hHhd0wA

Enjoyed the interview myself



fetersynergy
7:53 am
somewhere around 184.50 was NVDA previous ATH.   That can retest



PenelopeF
7:53 am
Thanks Daryll.  I'll check it out. 😄



fetersynergy
7:56 am
TSLL would be around 23



Kevo

c
cprimiani
8:12 am
any thoughts on pivot point for BSX? Brutal few weeks after ATH. Has history of sharp rebounds.


BobB
8:13 am
sold another 1/3 ELIL



fetersynergy
8:14 am
BSX has further to drop


Rejection was 100+/- area so 75 not out of the question



Daryll
8:14 am
took profits on nvda. 5 min bear div  with medium sell signal. Got my meat.  :)


thank you andy for levels and guidance



fetersynergy
8:17 am
sure Daryll.  For ASTS watch the previous high 56-57


T
TKinNV
8:19 am
WMT looks like it might be a buy, coming back from a drop today



BobB
8:21 am
sold 1/4 IBIT calls


B
Burker03
8:30 am
Andy, what do you see for GLW?



fetersynergy
8:32 am
watch how 85 reacts.   Above 85 puts 100 as a target


B
Burker03
8:34 am
Thanks



fetersynergy
8:37 am
NKE to 75+/- area.



mark7
8:38 am
HULL indicator keeping me in NCDA for now


NVDA*



fetersynergy
8:40 am
MSTY in the gap.  Not sure if it can be filled?


CVNA got a big price target change from Jeffries.   They went to 475 from 380.   The stock was a great short around 400 area today



RobMo
8:44 am
Andy what do you see Amzn? It seems it found a good support 



fetersynergy
8:49 am
RobMo. AMZN will bounce but has yet to reach a bottom



RobMo
8:53 am
thanks



fetersynergy
8:54 am
yup. 67 failing IBIT


m
mylyn
8:55 am
Andy, thank you so much on ELIL.  It was a very good trade for me.



PenelopeF
8:56 am
Andy - you mentioned IBIT yesterday with target of 68 if it can get over 67. I know it's only been around for not quite 2 years, but Nov was a great month last year. Thinking maybe 74 to 76 range in Nov? Your thoughts?



fetersynergy
8:59 am
Not going to split hairs but 67 is the previous high and they can provide a brick wall.   As far as 68.  There are structural waves.   If 67 = wave 3 I do not want to hold during a wave 4 so it is easier for me to sell 67 area and watch



PenelopeF
9:00 am
Thanks Andy.



fetersynergy
9:02 am
For LLY I would anticipate a move back to its 200 day where you will get a sense of this move.  The 200 day is $781.    A bounce there would put LLY to the gap at 848



BobB
9:03 am
sold another 1/4 IBIT calls



fetersynergy
9:04 am
AMBA is stronger than it looks



LisaD17
9:08 am
Amazing awesome call on LLY and ELIL Andy. You nailed it! And thx for bitcoin, IBIT comments, saying something like over $114000 goes much higher. Got in IBIT in various acts day or two ago, looking good. Andy you ROCK!!! Thank you!! :)



fetersynergy
9:08 am
sure Lisa rinse repeat.  Congrats



LisaD17
9:09 am
Any update on bitcoin levels to watch or thoughts? I went into MSTU too ..


Congrats to you too Andy!


T
TKinNV
9:13 am
GOOGL appears to be on the move above 241



fetersynergy
9:16 am
Just like IBIT. BTC previous high was 118k area



Nbmayerson
9:21 am
hi Andy I held HOOG do you see any upside ?


LisaD17
9:21 am
Meaning recent previous high? Just clarifying cuz bitcoin hit $124,290 Aug 14. Thank you!



Nasir
9:22 am
Thanks Andy on TSLL level, have been holding it since 13. May sell half today and keep the other half


Bought some IBM Puts for Oct 17th


b
batuk48
9:27 am
Andy, levels for ORCL please. It held around 20 day and today moving up.



fetersynergy
9:28 am
No previous high is the nearest.  when something goes down the highs become lower.  Lower highs lower lows.  BTC was here on Sept 18



Mike_M
9:28 am
Andy, what are you seeing for CRWV?



fetersynergy
9:29 am
Nikkei I am wating for HOOD to test 136.75 to 137.25.   At that point I can tell you what to watch



Nbmayerson
9:29 am
Ty Andy


fetersynergy
9:31 am
Because of what ORCL is doing.   I am not a fan.   Sure that is controversial but I still contend it will fill that gap.   Yes.  It can bounce but truth is.   Do not trust this stock below 300.  Ask yourself.   If ORCL was so great why can it not hold 300


CRWV falls into that category.  Can it get over previous high.   Above 145 I would buy a ton of it


CRWV will go back to (and possibly go past) its ATH


Once it is thru 145


yup HOOD testing its first support 138.50


b
batuk48
9:35 am
Thank you sir for the expaination. ORCL



Nbmayerson
9:35 am
ok so HOOG is what I have and I see it going up


fetersynergy
9:36 am
sure I think the market is starting to realize they are part of the data center overcapacity 


HOOG is a derivative of HOOD



Nbmayerson
9:36 am
yes thank you

M
Mostfavored100
9:36 am
Andy thanks KVUE gonna take some profit



Nasir
9:37 am
Andy, now that TSLA has broken the 455 resistance, where do u see it going next?



Mike_M
9:38 am
Thanks for CRWV Andy



LisaD17
9:38 am
thx Andy, totally get it on recent highs etc



fetersynergy
9:45 am
TSLA trades in 10.00 increments 465



mark7
9:46 am
Nice scalp in LLY



Nasir
9:46 am
thank you so much Andy, watching if the support holds then get in 



fetersynergy
9:51 am
two supports 452.65 then 450



Nasir
9:53 am
will keep that in the radar! watching to sell half of TSLL at 22.50 if it gets there


Any levels on IBM - seems it is over stretched and exhaustion coming soon. Had a great super cycle but cant seem to cross the previous day highs.

Hi Andy, NBIS 



fetersynergy
10:02 am
I flipped from TSLL to GGLL. Google moves different than TSLA


245 GOOGL



Nasir
10:03 am
thanks Andy, i will look at GGLL never traded it



fetersynergy
10:04 am
120 NBIS. it is a 2x's

10:06 am
Thank you Andy



fetersynergy
10:13 am
NVDA back to HOD



Nbmayerson
10:13 am
Andy thoughts on ASML range?


fetersynergy
10:16 am
ASML is a very gappy chart due to it being the largest company in Europe.  That said they will eventually push it to the ATH $1,100.  If you buy stock your fine if you do options you need time


t
tmas
10:17 am
Andy, WDC has been a monster - thanks for the suggestion. Do you have an updated range?



fetersynergy
10:18 am
A less expensive option would be ASMG 2x's long at $23.00


2x's long ASML


Wave 5 is 138 WDC so wave 3 terminates somewhere around 133?


I'm in at 88 so will sell 130 do not want to be here for wave 4


GOOGL going to trade into its 20 day SMA.  Will sell GGLL there


t
tmas
10:25 am
Andy, thanks WDC.

522-523



Daryll
10:29 am
meta triggering volume alert ?



Nasir
10:31 am
NVDA showing some life



Daryll
10:31 am
3 declining waves. Just interesting, nothing else is triggering. 



Vojta_L
10:31 am
Thank you MSFT



Daryll
10:38 am

Congrats on your TSLA wins. I'm holding TSLA LEAPS and other long dated calls.
