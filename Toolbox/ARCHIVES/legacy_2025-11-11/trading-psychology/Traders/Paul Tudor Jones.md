0:00
Thanks, Becky. Uh, boy, we got a lot of
0:01
news going on. Uh, we are joined right
0:03
now by legendary investor Paul Tudtor
0:05
Jones. He's the founder and CIO of Tutor
0:07
Investment Corporation. Of course, the
0:08
founder and board member at the Robin
0:10
Hood Foundation. We should mention that
0:11
on October 15th, Robin Hood's Foundation
0:13
is hosting its 13th annual investor
0:16
conference right here in New York City.
0:18
And we'll talk about that. Uh, but a lot
0:20
of headlines. You know, the Verizon
0:21
guys, you know, Schulman pretty well.
0:22
Actually,
0:22
Dan Schulman is chairman of Just
0:24
Capital. So, it's a great day for Dan, a
0:27
great day for corporate America, a great
0:29
day for America and capitalism.
0:31
Okay. So, let me ask you about the
0:32
markets though right now because we have
0:34
all these big headlines, including
0:36
today. We have this open AI deal with
0:38
AMD. AMD is ripping. There's these
0:39
warrants. Some people look at these as
0:41
sort of these circular deals. We had two
0:43
weeks ago a similar deal with Nvidia.
0:45
We've got a a big bank deal this
0:47
morning. We're going to hear uh from
0:48
Fifth Third's CEO in just a little bit.
0:52
You were, I think, dare I say, very
0:55
pessimistic the last time I saw you here
0:58
back in May. How do you feel now?
1:02
Um, well, it it it's like the Prince
1:06
song. It's 1999. Party like it's 1999,
1:10
right? Feels exactly like 1999. I don't
1:14
know whether we'll actually replay it
1:17
exactly, but I think all the ingredients
1:19
are in place and certainly from a
1:23
trading standpoint, you have to position
1:25
yourself like it's October 99. Um, I
1:29
don't see why you would do anything but
1:32
that. And remember, the NASDAQ doubled
1:35
between the first week of October 99 and
1:39
March of 2000. So if it looks like a
1:42
duck and quacks like a duck, it's
1:44
probably not a chicken, right?
1:45
But you think it's 99 and we were
1:47
talking to Mike Novagrats earlier today.
1:49
It's not 98. I mean, everyone's in the
1:52
it's either 98 99, but it's not 96, I
1:55
guess, is the point. And that's that's a
1:57
problem potentially,
1:58
right?
1:59
Or it's maybe an opportunity, but you
2:00
have to get on and off the train pretty
2:02
quick.
2:03
Well, if you just think about bull
2:05
markets, right? the the the greatest
2:08
price appreciation is always the 12
2:10
months preceding the top. So that's the
2:12
nature of a of a bull market. It kind of
2:14
doubles whatever the annual average is
2:16
and before then. So if you don't play it
2:19
right,
2:20
you're missing out on the juice. If you
2:23
do play it, you get you have to have
2:25
really happy feet because there will be
2:28
uh a really really bad end to it. And my
2:32
guess is that I think all the
2:34
ingredients are in place for some kind
2:36
of a blowoff. Will it happen? Again,
2:39
history rhymes a lot. So I would think
2:41
some version of it is going to happen
2:43
again. If if anything now is so much
2:48
more potentially explosive than 1999.
2:50
1999 we were looking at a rate hike in
2:53
November. Now we're looking at a rate
2:54
cut. We're looking at four more rate
2:57
hikes before we actually topped in 2000.
3:00
Now we're looking at four rate well
3:03
three or four rate cuts probably at
3:04
least. So you have monetary policy
3:08
that's going to take us to real rates of
3:12
zero or less probably depending upon the
3:14
next fed year. And then the big
3:16
difference is obviously fiscal policy.
3:18
We had a budget surplus in 99200. Now
3:21
we've got a 6% budget deficit. So that
3:25
combination that fiscal monetary
3:28
combination is a brew that we haven't
3:30
seen since I guess the post-war period
3:33
early 50s something like that and that
3:36
was crazy times right coming out of the
3:38
war
3:38
but you think that most people who are
3:40
watching us now you need to be in this
3:41
market now but then the question as I
3:43
said is you have to jump off the train
3:45
before the train crashes if you're
3:47
suggesting the train is going to crash
3:49
I'm not suggesting the train's going to
3:51
crash I'm suggesting that We're in a
3:54
period that's conducive for massive
3:57
price appreciation in a variety of
4:00
assets. Will it happen or not? I don't
4:03
know. There's if you kind of just look
4:05
if you just think about the leverage
4:08
that we had in 1999, you look at margin
4:10
debt and then you look at today margin
4:14
debt, but you have to throw in leverage
4:15
ETFs because people don't use margin
4:18
like they did back then. We're probably
4:20
a little more elevated than we were in
4:21
October of 99. It will take a
4:24
speculative frenzy for us to elevate
4:27
those prices, right? It will take more
4:30
retail buying. It'll take more
4:33
recruitment from a variety of other from
4:36
long short hedge funds, from real money,
4:38
etc. It'll take a a combination of those
4:41
things. It's not going to go up without
4:42
flows and without a story. The story is
4:45
there. It's the combination of the most
4:49
unique and aggressive fiscal and
4:51
monetary uh conditions that we've ever
4:54
seen.
4:54
Okay. If you're right, who are the
4:56
winners then in that and who are the
4:57
losers? Cuz right now we're looking at
4:59
Nvidia obviously being a major winner.
5:01
Even AMD today major winner, but there's
5:03
this unique arrangement that's almost
5:05
circular. Yeah, the circularity makes me
5:07
nervous. Um I would say and and I'm
5:11
going to think of it in broad terms. Um,
5:14
I think what the markets are telling
5:16
you, this is an inflation story down the
5:18
road. If you look at the biggest
5:19
winners, right, the biggest winners are
5:21
gold. I think it's up 46, 47%. Bitcoin,
5:26
I want to say it's up 50 or 60. I'm not
5:28
even sure. There's a Morgan Stanley
5:31
basket that's a retail flow basket that
5:34
has all the meme stocks and it's up 67,
5:37
68%.
5:39
So, it's really what retail jumps on.
5:43
So, crypto, digital, gold, that's
5:45
obviously something that's very, very
5:48
appealing.
5:48
Does that mean you're jumping on all of
5:49
that right now?
5:50
Well, I'd want to have positions in all
5:52
of it for sure.
5:53
So, if you said to me, what are going to
5:55
be the winners? Yeah. Again, we have
5:57
this race,
5:58
right? The race realistically is
6:01
certainly to the end of the year um
6:03
because that's when everyone marks
6:05
institutionally and then you have to
6:07
figure out what's going to go on in next
6:08
year. So what would I want to have? I'd
6:11
want to have a combination of um gold,
6:15
crypto, probably the NASDAQ. I I think I
6:19
want to say that I've said that before
6:21
and I think that's still the right one.
6:24
And I think uh whatever the fastest
6:26
horse is at this point in time probably
6:28
has a good chance of being that on deck
6:30
31.
6:31
Okay. Let me ask you though about this.
6:32
So I said that you were pessimistic the
6:34
last time I saw you. This was May 6,
6:37
2025. So just uh what couple months ago
6:41
you said for me it's pretty clear. This
6:42
is back in May. You have Trump who's
6:44
locked in tariffs. You have the Fed
6:46
who's locked in not cutting rates. That
6:48
is not good for the stock market. will
6:49
probably go down to new lows even when
6:52
Trump dials back China to 50%.
6:55
Correct.
6:57
That was really wrong, wasn't it?
6:58
Well, I'm curious what you think of that
7:01
now.
7:02
Uh what you think you got wrong?
7:04
At that point in time,
7:06
y
7:06
the stock market was still on the way
7:08
back up. It was still flirting with the
7:09
200 day moving average. I am really
7:12
simple.
7:13
Uh the one thing that I've learned in my
7:16
job is humility. how often we are wrong.
7:20
So, I'm going to always use as my
7:23
standard bearer the 200 day moving
7:26
average. I'll give you a great example.
7:28
Take the 200 day moving average in US
7:30
stock market. When we have easy
7:32
conditions right now and US stocks and
7:35
the Fed is easing, the stock market on
7:38
average doubles its return above the 200
7:41
day moving average. When it's below the
7:43
200 day moving average, which I think it
7:46
was at that point in time, and you're
7:48
easing and or tightening, you have
7:51
returns that are in single digits. So,
7:55
momentum, price momentum is
7:57
extraordinarily important to whatever
7:59
your trading/investment
8:01
thesis is. Nothing good ever happens
8:06
under the 200 day moving average in any
8:08
asset. So when the market changes, I'm
8:11
going to change with it too, right?
8:14
What do you think of the bond market
8:15
right now? I mean, are you surprised how
8:17
complacent it seems to be relative to
8:20
what seems like a lot of volatility, if
8:23
you will, in Washington?
8:24
So, so I've consistently believed that
8:27
the biggest bubble that we have is in
8:29
sovereign debt. And a great question,
8:33
one that I thought you would have asked
8:34
me rather than that one is why have we
8:37
not had a blow up in the bond market?
8:40
And of course the reason for that is
8:42
that now that we've embarked
8:44
this was the nicer cousin of that
8:45
question. Yes.
8:47
Uh the reason for that is because
8:51
with the easing cycle you've brought in
8:55
a whole bunch of flows attended with
8:58
that. We've taken asset managers $500
9:01
billion overweight. So we've pulled
9:05
forward all that demand in anticipation
9:08
of this easing cycle, right? So we've
9:11
pulled that forward. That's just one
9:13
example. You've pulled in mutual fund
9:15
and retail flows. So this easing cycle
9:19
has delayed but certainly not ended what
9:23
inevitably is going to be a huge problem
9:26
with sovereign debt somewhere down the
9:27
line.
9:28
What is the tipping point for that then?
9:29
Because there was always been this view
9:31
that the bond vigilantes would hold
9:33
Washington in check.
9:35
Oh, I think they ultimately will. I mean
9:37
again I think it's been delayed. I don't
9:40
think we ju just think about this year.
9:42
You've had elections in India, Korea,
9:46
Germany, this weekend in Japan. Every
9:49
one of those every single one of those
9:52
elections were for progrowth candidates.
9:55
Every single one of those countries are
9:57
expanding their budget deficits. It is
10:00
wild that we continue to go ahead and I
10:06
think probably England's the only place
10:08
because they actually have budget rules
10:10
where you're going to experiment with
10:12
austerity. Every other place we're going
10:14
to grow our way out of the problem. And
10:17
so I I feel it's a bit like uh I feel
10:22
it's a bit like Star Trek. we're kind of
10:24
boldly going where no man has ever gone
10:28
before. Uh and that's that's where I
10:30
feel like we're doing in sovereign debt
10:32
markets. And of course, when you're
10:34
going to see it manifest itself, a
10:36
problem is going to be at the end of
10:38
this easing cycle when all that demand
10:40
has been pushed forward. If you look at
10:43
uh the amount of debt that's going to be
10:45
required to be financed next year, which
10:48
is with the AI buildout is going to even
10:51
go up once you add the corporate line
10:53
item on top of the sovereign line item.
10:56
Um you're still looking at a huge
10:59
increase in supply of debt, much larger
11:02
than I think the market could handle
11:06
in normal times. But again, we're in the
11:08
easing cycle. So, we continue to bring
11:11
in these flows. And when that easing
11:13
cycle ends a year from now, yeah,
11:17
probably a year year from now, it's
11:19
going to be really interesting to see
11:21
how the bond markets do at that point in
11:23
time.
11:24
Um, all of these conversations we're
11:25
having right now, you're about to have
11:27
in a very big way with some really
11:28
interesting investors um in about a week
11:31
from now. What's on tap?
11:33
So, in our investor conference, we have
11:35
a hell of a lineup. We got Jamie Diamond
11:38
and Ken Griffin. I'm going to interview
11:40
Dario Modi. I'm so excited about that
11:43
one. That one's the one that on a
11:46
personal level I have the greatest
11:47
interest in because I think of the tech
11:49
titans, he's the most honest, the most
11:53
transparent. Uh, and I want to get him
11:55
to update his views on what he thinks
11:59
the actual displacement will be uh in
12:02
employment. Remember, he's used a number
12:04
anywhere from 5 to 20%. So I'm really
12:07
interested in hearing him talk about
12:08
that. Uh again, if I think about AI that
12:13
also again
12:16
much like Star Trek, we're boldly going
12:19
where no man has ever gone before. The
12:21
only difference is we don't have Captain
12:24
James Tiberius Kirk,
12:26
right?
12:26
Uh leading the ship. We have no one
12:28
leading the ship. Um we don't have
12:31
science officer Spock to bring in logic
12:34
and reason. the few people that bring
12:36
that in um get run over by those that
12:40
argue we can't have any regulation. Of
12:42
course, if we stop that, then we're
12:44
going to stop we're going to stop the
12:45
progress of artificial intelligence. And
12:48
it's it's really interesting because we
12:49
just did a poll with the American
12:51
public. And so 83% of the American
12:54
public thinks AI will be a net social
12:57
positive.
12:59
Um which is great. I believe that.
13:02
There's no question. And it's it's it's
13:04
so fascinating because it's a two-phase
13:06
phenomena, right? You have so many
13:08
fantastic things that are going to come
13:09
from it,
13:10
but then you also got these incredible
13:13
threats. So, you're constantly torn
13:16
between the good and the bad side of AI.
13:18
What I wish from those like Dario would
13:23
be to not just acknowledge the fact that
13:26
we also have threats that come from AI,
13:30
but to actually begin to think about how
13:33
societyy's going to deal with those cuz
13:35
we know it's going to bring these
13:37
wonderful things and that's fantastic.
13:38
But it's also potentially going to bring
13:40
job displacement. Uh we're going to have
13:43
higher electric bills for a whole
13:45
variety of people, environmental
13:46
concerns. And then of course you have
13:48
the safety issues. So we we've just done
13:51
some great polling at Just Capital. Uh
13:54
and it's so interesting because if you
13:57
ask the American public what they think
14:00
AI should be spending for instance on AI
14:02
safety right now companies spend a
14:05
quarter of 1% of total spend on AI
14:09
safety. The American public thinks that
14:11
number should be 5% or greater. So
14:14
again, there's a interesting dialogue to
14:17
be continued on that and hopefully we'll
14:19
see some more rational thinking with
14:22
regard to how we should be managing this
14:25
fantastic product in a way that benefits
14:28
society in the greatest way.
14:29
It sounds like we're going to have it's
14:30
all going to come at the same time,
14:31
meaning we're going to have the
14:33
employment issues that you're talking
14:34
about. At the same time, we might even
14:36
have a little bit of a bust in the boom
14:38
cycle.
14:40
Again, uh history rhymes a lot. Who
14:43
knows exactly how it's going to play
14:44
out. It it is a very combustible
14:47
situation from investing standpoint. And
14:49
it's also going to be the one thing we
14:52
know about the the AI boom is there
14:53
going to be some huge winners, right?
14:55
Some huge losers. It's like every great
14:57
technology, right? You you you you
15:00
But that's the question. Do you do you
15:01
invest? Did you say Nvidia, AMD, the big
15:04
guys are all the winners? Look, Amazon
15:06
was a winner. Pets.com was a loser. Was
15:09
that obvious to you then? Um well, you
15:13
just what you knew at that time with and
15:16
again what you knew at that time is at
15:19
some point in time there was going to be
15:22
an end to the cycle because uh inflation
15:26
a variety of other things. We're in this
15:27
really crazy situation where we're
15:31
looking at
15:33
8 months from now, we're going to have a
15:35
new Fed chair who probably is going to
15:37
have rates depending upon who they
15:40
choose somewhere between two and 3% Fed
15:43
funds at 2 and 3%. Negative real rates
15:46
with a 6% budget deficit.
15:48
Right.
15:50
You wrote 1929. You tell me what's going
15:52
to happen.
15:54
It's a longer conversation. I no I'm
15:56
genuinely concerned and I think but I
15:58
think the question is how much leverage
15:59
is in is in the system. That to me is
16:01
the fundamental issue. Every crisis is a
16:03
function of too much leverage in the
16:04
system.
16:05
Okay. So where we are right now if I'm
16:07
just thinking the stock market
16:08
kind of in 99 it was around 1.7% of
16:11
market cap was margin debt. Today you've
16:14
got to throw in lever ETFs right
16:16
because you can't margin debt really
16:19
doesn't have the same function it had 26
16:21
years 25 years ago. You throw that in.
16:24
probably starting at about 2.2%. It it
16:27
added
16:28
1% of market cap at the top in 2000. My
16:33
guess is we'll exceed that. But again,
16:36
you need to be looking at some
16:38
combination of leverage ETFs, margin
16:40
debt of variety, those things. That will
16:42
be I think a great way of measuring the
16:45
pulse of what speculative frenzy may
16:48
come.
16:49
Well, we will see. Um, congratulations
16:51
on the upcoming event. Thank you for
16:52
joining us this morning. Thank you so
16:54
much. It's always wonderful being here
16:55
and go Robin Hood. We have to help the
16:59
least among us and particularly the
17:01
people that watch this that profit from
17:03
it have a responsibility to do too to do
17:05
so.
17:06
Absolutely.
17:06
Thank you.
