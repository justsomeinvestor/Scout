1. Sept 30 = last day of the quarter.  Conversely Oct. 1 first day of quarter.   They are always choppy - Quarter turn = portfolio adjustments 

2.Gold has a few advantages in that it is the investment of choice for hedging the dollar for forex traders also.   
  Dollar down gold up has been a mantra for as long as I have been trading.
  I believe we are about to start a commodity cycle.  2000 to 2008 commodities outperformed all other assets.

3. Market does not tolerate gap opens at extreme valuations.  10/15/25





What Andy watches for during earnings season

1)     Seasonality of Stock

2)     Last year same time frame earnings – what happened?

3)     Past Earnings calls and expected guidance

4)     Past 3-5 days of stock price

5)     Volatility of movement on earnings

6)     If options, then to check pricing of options and IV

7)     Stock chart without saying!

8)     What market is thinking – more call buyers or put buyers

If I am 80% sure of movement either direction, i will enter the trade early on otherwise will play on the call. One has to be ready for wild swings in and out and catch the scalps. Wild swings always happen as soon as earnings announced and then they retreat a bit and move again. That is where the opportunity lies.

Please be careful and keep your losses to minimum. Losses will happen but never panic, get out and trade the direction! 

Good Luck to All on Earnings!
