Me - Daryll. I am the builder of this system, with AI assistance of course. This is to help you understand who I am. 

My goal is $69 a day or more to cover my costs of living. I am a professional retail trader and investor.


Collect of thought on trading and investing from me. Weight - 9

Ranges are very important


Always consider if spy and qqq are at resistence and their action on the day so far


The fib 127 ext may be a good short area, just for a pullback trade, there will be a reaction

======================================================================
Profile & Intent
======================================================================
- Identity: Retail trader/investor building a pro‑grade research + execution system.
- Objective: Consistent, sustainable income (≥ $69/day) while protecting downside.
- Focus markets: SPY, QQQ, BTC, ETH (expand later if signal quality supports).
- Style: Rules‑driven, level‑based execution with discretionary filter from research.
- Edge: Multi‑source synthesis (YouTube/RSS/Technicals/X) + signal engine + disciplined risk.

Operating Principles (AI, remember these)
- Actionable first: translate research into 3–5 clear options with entries/stops/targets.
- Levels > opinions: hard levels drive plans; narratives only adjust size/urgency.
- Risk always on: define risk before reward; assume volatility expands from lows.
- Breadth is a governor: weak breadth = smaller size and fewer adds, wait for confirmation.
- Sentiment is a gauge: use X sentiment as contrarian only at extremes; otherwise neutral.
- Keep it simple: fewer, higher‑quality trades beat frequent impulses.

Timeframes & Setups I Trade
- Swing (days–weeks): SPY/QQQ trend or mean‑reversion around 50/200‑DMA; BTC/ETH range break/pullback.
- Intraday (selective): Only when levels align with higher‑timeframe bias.
- Preferred setups:
  1) SPX breakout continuation: above 6,720 → target 6,760 then 7,000 (SPY ~672/676/700).
  2) SPX pullback buy: 6,612–6,650 zone; invalidation below 6,612 (SPY ~661–665; stop < 661.2 eqv.).
  3) BTC liquidity sweep: $111–112K sweep and reclaim → target $118K+, stop below $108K.
  4) ETH value zone: around $4,000 support; confirmation via higher low and volume.
  5) Volatility hedge: when VIX < ~17 and signal is mixed → initiate/roll VIX calls or BTC straddles.

Risk Management (non‑negotiable)
- Position sizing: derive from stop distance; size down when breadth weak or vol compressed.
- Pyramiding: only add after progress + HL/HH structure; never average losers.
- Max simultaneous core positions: keep focus (CONFIGURE: e.g., 3–5).
- Hard stops: pre‑set; move to break‑even only after objective progress, not emotion.
- Daily limits: stop trading after daily max loss or 3 consecutive losers (CONFIGURE values).
- Hedging: prefer options hedges (VIX calls / put spreads) when composites < 70 and breadth weak.

Signal Engine → Action Map
- Composite ≥ 85: Extreme Buy — act decisively; full plan with size increase and clear risk.
- 70–84: Strong Buy — take the setup; standard size; favor continuation entries.
- 55–69: Moderate Buy — cautious participation; partial size; require clean level and confirmation.
- 40–54: Weak/Wait — no new core risk; focus on hedges/scouting.
- < 40: Avoid/Sell — defense first; consider hedges or exits.

Daily Routine (Sessions)
- Pre‑market: set alerts at key levels; place conditional orders; review scheduled events.
- Open: avoid chasing first 5–10 min; wait for confirmation against levels.
- Midday: protect P&L; only A+ setups; review breadth/vol updates.
- Power hour: act on breakouts/breakdowns into pre‑planned levels; manage exits.
- After‑hours: journal, update quick actions, prep tomorrow.

Pre‑Trade Checklist
- What is the higher‑timeframe bias (trend/breadth/vol/sentiment)?
- Exact entry, stop, target(s); R multiple ≥ 2 where possible.
- Position size consistent with stop and confidence tier.
- Conflicts: is there a narrative or breadth warning that reduces size?
- Event risk in the next 24–48h? If yes, size down or hedge.

In‑Trade Rules
- Follow plan; if invalidation hits, exit — no negotiation.
- Trailing only after structural progress (pivot break/HL/HH), not time alone.
- No add unless fresh signal + improved R/R.

Post‑Trade Review
- Log: setup type, score tier, reasoning, emotions, adherence to plan, improvement item.
- Tag errors: impatience, FOMO, revenge trading, over‑sizing, late add, stop moves.

Cognitive Pitfalls (watchouts)
- Chasing moves after they leave the level.
- Overconfidence during low‑vol grinds; forgetting mean reversion risk.
- Confirmation bias from a single provider; require cross‑source confluence.

What I Want From The AI Assistant
- Condense noise into 3–5 Quick Actions with: type, entry, stop, target, urgency.
- Keep “Refreshed” timestamps for every summary and overview you use.
- Call out breadth/vol caveats explicitly and suggest size/hedge adjustments.
- Prefer Node/Python tools (avoid PowerShell automation unless I request it).
- Use clear, copy‑ready orders and alerts with symbols/levels.

Core Levels To Anchor (current context)
- SPX: 6,612 (must hold), 6,650 (support), 6,720 (breakout), 6,760 (major), 7,000 (path).
- SPY (approx): 661–665 support; 672/676 resistance; 700 stretch.
- QQQ: 593–597 support (provisional until TradingView QQQ provider lives).
- BTC: $111–112K sweep/reclaim long; $118–120K resistance; $108K invalidation.
- ETH: $4,000 support; watch $5,000+ targets on momentum.

When To Stand Down
- Composite < 40 or severe breadth divergence + event risk.
- After daily max loss or clear plan violation — pause and review.
- If levels are unclear/clustered — wait for clarity; trading is optional.

Longer‑Term Orientation
- Allocation template as default posture (adjust tactically): Equities 60% | Gold 30% | BTC 10%.
- Liquidity cycle and macro regime guide medium‑term tilt; entries still come from levels.

Notes to Self
- Let price come to your level — alerts do the work.
- Size is a function of clarity and context, not conviction alone.
- Patience compounds edge; protecting the downside keeps me in the game.
