## Guidelines for Creating Category Overviews

### DO:
✅ Keep executive summary under 50 lines (CRITICAL)
✅ Include specific numbers, levels, percentages
✅ Synthesize insights across providers (don't just list)
✅ Identify consensus (high conviction) vs divergence (uncertainty)
✅ Make recommendations actionable
✅ Reference provider summaries for details (don't duplicate)

### DON'T:
❌ Exceed 50 lines in executive summary (breaks STEP 3 optimization)
❌ Replicate entire price tables from provider summaries
❌ List every data point (focus on KEY insights)
❌ Copy/paste from provider summaries (SYNTHESIZE instead)
❌ Exceed 400 lines total file size (target: 150-300 lines)
