## What Was NOT Updated (Phase 3 - Deferred)

The following sections have Oct 28 data but are lower priority for user decision-making:

### Deferred Changes (Phase 3):
1. **Economic Calendar** - Contains Oct 24-31 (past events) - could replace with Nov 1-7 forward calendar
2. **Upcoming Catalysts** - Still references FOMC Oct 29 (past event)
3. **Research Highlights** - Contains Oct 28 dated items
4. **Data Anomalies** - Still references Oct 28 data
5. **Provider Consensus Themes** - Contains old narrative
6. **Options Data (SPY/QQQ)** - Last updated "2025-10-27"
7. **X Sentiment Ticker Velocities** - Detailed ticker mention data

**Rationale for Deferral:** These sections are context/detail level. The critical user-facing updates (signal scores, key levels, AI interpretation, daily guidance) are complete. Phase 3 items would add completeness but don't change user action recommendations.
