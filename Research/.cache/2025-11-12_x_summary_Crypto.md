## Bottom line

- **General mood:** The feed is *net neutral* but tilted bullish on BTC, ETH, Solana and staking/LSTs, while a handful of tokens receive bearish “bubble‑break” calls.  
- **Primary opportunities:** BTC/ETH ETF‑related assets, staking/LST platforms, Solana & other scaling L1s, and AI‑driven DeFi projects that just announced token sales.  
- **Primary risks:** Fed‑driven slides, regulatory re‑classification, and the bearish 90 % drop predictions on a few niche tokens.  
- **Whale signals:** Look for further capital infusions (e.g., $ICP, $Lighter) and keep an eye on upcoming SEC taxonomy updates.  

Use the stated price targets and liquidation data to time entries/exits, and hedge against macro‑risk with volatility or short‑term futures as the Fed‑hawk cycle accelerates.
