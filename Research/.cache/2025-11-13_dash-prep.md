## Step 3F: Signal Calculation & Tier Assignment ⏳

### Weighted Signal Scoring:

**Component Scores (0-100 scale):**
- **Trend (30% weight):** 70/100 → Contribution: 21.0
- **Breadth (25% weight):** 65/100 → Contribution: 16.25
- **Volatility (20% weight):** 60/100 → Contribution: 12.0
- **Sentiment (15% weight):** 58/100 → Contribution: 8.7
- **Technical (10% weight):** 65/100 → Contribution: 6.5

**Total Weighted Signal Score:** 21.0 + 16.25 + 12.0 + 8.7 + 6.5 = **64.45/100**

### Tier Assignment:

| Tier | Range | Definition |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **WEAK** | 0-33 | Bearish, high risk |
| **MODERATE** | 34-66 | Mixed, balanced risk |
| **STRONG** | 67-83 | Bullish, controlled risk |
| **EXTREME** | 84-100 | Very bullish, tail risk |

**Signal Score: 64.45 → Tier: MODERATE (Upper Range)**

### Interpretation:
- Signal is **bullish-leaning** but not yet "strong"
- Awaiting confirmation from Thursday CPI data
- Risk management framework in place (drawdown triggers at 6%, 13%)
- Shutdown resolution provides immediate upside, but policy uncertainty caps gains
- Optimal positioning: **Long equities with trailing stops, staged approach**

### Actionable Summary:
1. ✅ **Initiate:** Small long positions (50-75% allocation)
2. ⚠️ **Monitor:** CPI release Thursday (major inflection point)
3. 🛑 **Risk:** Tight stops at 6% drawdown (SPY: ~643, QQQ: ~585)
4. 📈 **Opportunity:** Re-entry to full allocation (100%) if CPI confirms disinflation
