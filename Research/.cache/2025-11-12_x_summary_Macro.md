**7. High‑Engagement Posts**  
All 15 posts received zero likes/retweets in the data provided; therefore no “high‑engagement” posts can be identified.

**Bottom line:**  
- Bullish sentiment dominates around Waymo, institutional ETF launches, and crypto accumulation.  
- Bearish signals focus on Oracle’s technical breakdown and aggressive shorting strategies.  
- Institutional momentum is strongest in leveraged ETF offerings, suggesting increased professional allocation.  
- Traders should monitor Oracle’s pivot levels, the performance of $NBIS after its dip, and the leveraged ETFs for sector‑specific exposure. Risk management is crucial for the high‑volatility strategies mentioned.
