**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Varies significantly; defensive sectors often perform relatively well
- Weakest: Cyclical sectors often lag as uncertainty increases

- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: <0.05
- Significance: Significant returns above historical average; longest economic phase typically lasting ~3 years

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: Unknown - transition to late expansion or recession
- Event: Growth deceleration signals or Fed policy shift
- Expected Impact: Shift toward defensive positioning as expansion ages

**Failure Conditions:**
- Fed policy mistake causing premature recession
- External shock (geopolitical, pandemic, financial crisis)
- Inflation resurgence forcing aggressive tightening

**Trading Implications:**
Currently in this phase. Favor quality growth and cyclicals. Technology and financials historically lead. Most market corrections occur during this phase but don't derail expansion. Narrow sector dispersion with most sectors benefiting.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Technology (Z-score +7.6, 82% outperformance), Financials (Z-score +8.0, 91% consistency), Consumer Discretionary

- P-Value: <0.10
- Significance: Marginally significant; timing of phase transitions difficult to predict

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: Unknown - could be current phase or upcoming
- Event: GDP growth deceleration, capacity utilization peaks, Fed maintains restrictive policy
- Expected Impact: Defensive rotation intensifies; positive but decelerating growth

**Failure Conditions:**
- Premature recession without warning signs
- Successful soft landing extending expansion
- Fiscal stimulus preventing slowdown

**Trading Implications:**
Defensive positioning warranted. Corporate profit growth slows and investors rotate to quality. Rising inflation concerns and restrictive Fed policy. Increase allocation to consumer staples and healthcare while reducing cyclical exposure.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Consumer Staples (Z-score +8.1, 73% outperformance), Healthcare (Z-score +7.3), Industrials
- Weakest: Real Estate (Z-score -10.8), Consumer Discretionary (Z-score -5.4), Materials

- Lookback Period: 1974-2020

**Confidence:**
- Score: 90/100
- Level: Very High
- P-Value: <0.001
- Significance: Highly significant; negative returns extremely consistent during NBER-dated recessions

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: Unknown - moderate risk next 12-24 months given late-cycle dynamics
- Event: NBER declares recession (typically after onset)
- Expected Impact: Sharp equity declines; defensive sectors provide relative protection

**Failure Conditions:**
- Pattern fails if labeled "recession" is very brief/shallow (like 2020 COVID)
- Aggressive Fed/fiscal support prevents major declines
- Forward-looking markets already bottomed before declaration

**Trading Implications:**
Maximum defensive positioning required. Only consumer staples show positive absolute returns on average (+1.0%). Markets typically bottom before recession ends. Strategy: hold cash and defensive sectors; gradually scale into cyclicals as recession matures.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Consumer Staples (+1.0% only positive sector), Utilities (-1.6%), Healthcare (-2.9%)
- Weakest: Real Estate (-21.6%), Technology (-20.3%), Financials (-13.3%)

## Santa Rally

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** santa_rally

- Lookback Period: 1950-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 70/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: <0.005
- Significance: Persistent pattern over 75 years but 2024 failure raises caution; most robust short-term seasonal effect

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-24
- Event: Last 5 trading days of year begin
- Expected Impact: Short-term bullish spike averaging 1.3% over 7 trading days

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major geopolitical event during window
- Fed surprise hawkish announcement mid-rally
- Heavy year-end tax loss selling overwhelming seasonal bid
- Market already significantly overbought

**Trading Implications:**
Enter long positions 1-2 weeks before Dec 24, target 1-2% gain, exit by Jan 3. Pattern strongest when market is flat or slightly down YTD. Predictive power: positive Santa Rally suggests +10.4% average following year vs +6.1% after failure.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Consumer Discretionary (holiday retail), Technology, Small-Caps (Russell 2000: 74% win rate)
- Weakest: Energy, Materials, Defensives (underperform on relative basis)

## January Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** january_effect
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in period
**Period:** 2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31
**Days Until Start:** 49

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: 0.98%
- Median Return: 0.9%
- Win Rate: 54% (January positive, full year positive 82%)

- Best Return: Januarys 1975-1976 (outliers)
- Worst Return: Various negative Januarys (46% of time)
- Lookback Period: 1928-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 30/100
- Level: Low
- P-Value: Historical <0.05, Modern (post-2000) >0.10
- Significance: WAS highly significant pre-1990s; effect has DISAPPEARED for large-caps since 2000; marginally present in small-caps only

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2026-01-02 (first trading day)
- Event: January trading begins
- Expected Impact: January barometer matches full-year direction 77% of time but effect weakened substantially

**Failure Conditions:**
- Modern market efficiency has essentially eliminated this pattern
- Trading costs and algorithmic trading arbitraged away historical edge
- Small residual effect remains only in illiquid small-caps

**Trading Implications:**
Not reliable for tactical trading. January Barometer (if January positive, year likely positive) has 77% historical accuracy but barely better than coin flip for predicting declines. Effect has diminished to near-zero for SPY/large-caps post-2000.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Historically small-cap financials and industrials (effect weakening)
- Weakest: No consistent pattern in modern era

## Sell in May

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** sell_in_may
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** In "Best Six Months" period
**Period:** 2026-05-01 to 2026-10-31 (unfavorable period)
**Days Until Start:** 169

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: May-Oct +1.8% vs Nov-Apr +7.5% (difference: ~6%)
- Median Return: Summer period +1.5%
- Win Rate: May-Oct positive 65% of time (but weaker than winter)
- Sample Size: 75 years (323 years globally across 114 countries)
- Std Deviation: Higher in summer due to lower volumes
- Best Return: Individual summers can be strong (2024: +4.9%)
- Worst Return: May-Oct 2022: -9.3%
- Lookback Period: 1950-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 65/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: <0.01 (global pooled data)
- Significance: Strong historical and global evidence but effect weakening in recent decade; not recommended to exit market completely

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2026-05-01
- Event: "Sell in May" period begins (weaker 6-month period historically)
- Expected Impact: Lower average returns May-October vs November-April; still positive majority of time

**Failure Conditions:**
- Strong momentum entering summer can override pattern
- Major monetary/fiscal stimulus during summer months
- Election years show different dynamics (better summers)

**Trading Implications:**
Don't exit market completely but consider tactical underweight during summer. Best strategy: double exposure Nov-Apr, hold T-bonds May-Oct. Last 11 years show median summer return +3.1% (82% positive), suggesting pattern weakening but still present.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: May-Oct favor defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples, Healthcare) on relative basis
- Weakest: Cyclicals underperform relatively (Technology, Discretionary, Financials)

## September Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** september_effect
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in month
**Period:** 2026-09-01 to 2026-09-30

- Lookback Period: 1928-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 70/100
- Level: Moderate-High
- P-Value: Statistically significant as worst month
- Significance: ONLY month with consistently negative average return; pattern STRENGTHENING in recent 5 years (-4.2% avg last 5 years)

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2026-09-01
- Event: September trading begins
- Expected Impact: Elevated risk of negative returns; 9 of 40 worst monthly losses occurred in September

**Failure Conditions:**
- Strong uptrend momentum can override (September positive 45-48% of time)
- Major positive catalyst overcoming seasonal weakness
- Fiscal year-end dynamics less pronounced (if structural factors change)

**Trading Implications:**
Maximum caution warranted. Reduce risk exposure, tighten stops, increase defensive positioning. Pattern strengthening in recent years (last 5 years much worse than historical average). More useful for risk management than active shorting.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Defensive sectors relatively outperform (Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples)
- Weakest: Technology often weak, Financials vulnerable to fiscal year-end adjustments

## Summer Doldrums

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** summer_doldrums
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in period
**Period:** 2026-06-01 to 2026-08-31
**Days Until Start:** 200

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +1.5% to +2.0% (combined Jun-Aug)

- Lookback Period: 1950-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 40/100
- Level: Low
- P-Value: Summer vs winter difference p<0.05, but individual summer months variable
- Significance: Historical pattern exists but highly variable and WEAKENING in modern era; July often strong despite "doldrums" narrative

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2026-06-01
- Event: Summer trading period begins
- Expected Impact: Lower volume (20-30% decline), higher volatility despite sideways/modest gains; pattern often defied recently

**Failure Conditions:**
- Strong secular trends override seasonal weakness (2020, 2023, 2024 examples)
- Presidential election years show better summer performance (73% win rate)
- Major monetary stimulus during summer months

**Trading Implications:**
Pattern unreliable for market timing. Summer 2024 showed strong performance despite traditional "doldrums." Trading volume drops and volatility can spike on thin liquidity but returns often positive. Not actionable for tactical trading in modern markets.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Energy (summer driving season), Travel/Leisure (Airlines, Hotels), Retail (back-to-school)
- Weakest: Relative underperformance from Discretionary and Technology historically, but recent years defying pattern

## October Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** october_effect
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in month
**Period:** 2026-10-01 to 2026-10-31
**Days Until Start:** 322

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +1.4% (POSITIVE, contrary to reputation)
- Median Return: +1.2%
- Win Rate: 58%
- Sample Size: 80+ years

- Worst Return: -16.8% (2008), -22.6% single day (1987)
- Lookback Period: 1945-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 60/100 (returns), 80/100 (volatility)
- Level: Moderate for returns, High for volatility
- P-Value: <0.01 for volatility; NOT significant for negative returns (actually positive average)
- Significance: Volatility prediction highly reliable; return direction unreliable despite reputation

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Event: October trading begins
- Expected Impact: Expect highest volatility of any month; direction unpredictable but historically positive average; late-month rallies common

**Failure Conditions:**
- Pattern about volatility, not direction, so "failure" would be low volatility (rare)
- Major crashes possible but not the norm (1929, 1987, 2008 are outliers)

**Trading Implications:**
Prepare for volatility, not necessarily declines. "October Rebound" pattern shows late-month strength often leads into year-end rally. Many bull markets start in October. Strategy: maintain positions through volatility, use weakness to scale in for Q4 strength.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Late-month cyclical leadership (Financials, Industrials, Tech) during rebounds
- Weakest: Early-month defensive positioning (Utilities, Staples, Healthcare) then rotation

**Confidence:**
- Score: 75/100
- Level: High
- P-Value: Pattern described as "statistically quite bullish"
- Significance: Strongest consecutive two-month period historically; November ranks 3rd best month, December 2nd best

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-01
- Event: December begins (continuation of strong seasonal period)
- Expected Impact: Continuation of favorable seasonal tailwind through year-end

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major crisis or recession (overrides seasonal patterns)
- Severe year-end tax loss selling
- Fed hawkish surprise in December FOMC
- Market already significantly overextended

**Trading Implications:**

- Worst Return: Various negative weeks (25-32% of time)
- Lookback Period: 1950-2024

**Confidence:**
- Score: 70/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: "Statistically significant" per Bank of America analysis but weakening in recent subsamples
- Significance: Above-average weekly return (0.54% vs 0.16% normal) with lower volatility; election years stronger (75% win rate)

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-11-26 (Wednesday before Thanksgiving)
- Event: Pre-holiday trading begins; volume drops 25-30%
- Expected Impact: Modest positive bias +0.5% for holiday week; day before Thanksgiving typically strongest

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major news event disrupting holiday period
- Severe sell-off preceding holiday creating momentum
- Black Friday retail data disappointing significantly

**Trading Implications:**
Day before Thanksgiving (T-1) shows strong positive with low volatility. Black Friday (T+1) positive +0.3% average. Second day after (T+2) weak/negative with high volatility. Enter small long positions before holiday, exit Monday/Tuesday after. Works best in election years like 2025.

**ID:** turn_of_month
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Outside TOM window
**Period:** Last trading day + first 3 trading days (4-day window)
**Days Until Next:** 15 (November TOM: Nov 28, Dec 1-3)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +0.473% per TOM day vs +0.349% full month (historical)
- Median Return: Historical studies show concentration of gains in TOM window
- Win Rate: 64% (historical 4-day window)
- Sample Size: 100+ years historical; hundreds of monthly occurrences

- Worst Return: Effect disappears during financial crises
- Lookback Period: 1897-2000 (strongest), 2010-2024 (weakened)

**Confidence:**
- Score: 35/100
- Level: Low
- P-Value: WAS significant pre-2010; recent data shows NO significance for US large-caps (4-day window)
- Significance: CRITICAL WARNING - Classic 4-day TOM effect has largely DISAPPEARED for SPY/US large-caps since 2010; 7-day window shows modest residual effect

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-11-28 (last trading day of November)
- Event: TOM window begins (Nov 28, Dec 1-3)
- Expected Impact: Historically +0.47% vs 0.35% normal, but modern effect near zero for large-caps

**Failure Conditions:**
- Effect has essentially already failed in modern era
- Market efficiency, algorithmic trading, and reduced settlement times eliminated historical edge

**Trading Implications:**
Not actionable for US large-cap equities. Classic 4-day window shows NO statistical significance for SPY in recent decade. Extended 7-day window (days -3,-2,-1,+1,+2,+3) shows modest 5-12 basis point daily edge but declining. Better opportunities in international/emerging market ETFs where effect persists.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Effect not sector-specific; originally thought driven by pension fund flows
- Weakest: No consistent pattern; TOM effect was market-wide phenomenon when present

## First-of-Month Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** first_trading_day
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not on first trading day
**Period:** First trading day of each month
**Days Until Next:** 18 (December 1, 2025)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +0.24% to +0.25%
- Median Return: +0.74%
- Win Rate: 64%
- Sample Size: 300 first trading days (25 years × 12 months)
- Std Deviation: Higher variability than TOM effect
- Best Return: February first trading day (historically strongest)
- Worst Return: When negative, average loss -2.55%
- Lookback Period: 1998-2024

**Confidence:**
- Score: 55/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Statistically significant post-1997; effect weakened post-2008 (0.18% vs 0.24%)
- Significance: "Fairly recent development" emerging ~1997; Monte Carlo studies confirm significance but effect "too unstable and unreliable to be traded" as standalone

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-02 (first trading day of December)
- Event: Monthly automatic investments (401k, pension funds, dollar-cost averaging) deployed
- Expected Impact: Historical +0.24% vs +0.04% average day (6x better); modern effect persists but inconsistent

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major negative news on first trading day
- Market already severely extended
- Month following significant prior-month decline

**Trading Implications:**
Modest positive bias remains but high variability month-to-month. Annualized return of only trading first day: +15.3% historically. Effect strongest in February and July; weakest in summer months. Requires additional filters for reliable implementation. Better as supplementary signal than primary strategy.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Technology shows strong first-day gains historically
- Weakest: Effect driven by automatic fund flows, applies across sectors broadly

## Monday Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** monday_effect
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Day-of-week patterns
**Period:** Monday trading sessions
**Days Until Next:** 4 (November 18, 2025)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: -12.33 basis points (full sample 1926-2014)
- Median Return: Below zero historically
- Win Rate: 39.2% (vs 62% for Friday historically)
- Sample Size: 100+ years daily data
- Std Deviation: Higher on Mondays than other weekdays
- Best Return: N/A (negative effect historically)
- Worst Return: October 19, 1987 Black Monday (-22%)
- Lookback Period: 1926-2014

**Confidence:**
- Score: 25/100
- Level: Very Low
- P-Value: Pre-1975 p<0.05; Post-1975 p>0.10 (NOT significant)
- Significance: CRITICAL WARNING - Effect has DISAPPEARED since 1975; major studies published AFTER effect ended; essentially non-existent in modern markets

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-11-18 (next Monday)
- Event: Monday trading
- Expected Impact: Modern data shows NO consistent Monday underperformance for US large-caps; some studies show Monday slightly positive recently

**Failure Conditions:**
- Effect has essentially already failed
- Settlement changes (T+1), lower trading costs, algorithmic trading eliminated historical edge
- Individual investors less dominant in price discovery

**Trading Implications:**
Not actionable. Monday effect disappeared ~1975 but studies confirming it published in early 1980s (after it ended). Recent data shows Monday-to-Tuesday close actually BEST day-to-day return (+0.12%). Pattern may persist in emerging markets but absent in US large-caps.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Effect was broader market phenomenon; individual investor-heavy stocks showed larger historical effect
- Weakest: No consistent modern pattern

## Friday Effect

**Category:** Seasonality
**ID:** friday_effect
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Day-of-week patterns
**Period:** Friday trading sessions
**Days Until Next:** 2 (November 15, 2025)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: Higher than weekly average historically
- Median Return: Positive bias
- Win Rate: 62% (1953-1970 study)
- Sample Size: 70+ years daily data
- Std Deviation: Slightly higher than mid-week days
- Best Return: Various strong Fridays
- Worst Return: Options expiration Fridays show different pattern (slightly negative)
- Lookback Period: 1953-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 45/100
- Level: Low-Moderate
- P-Value: Less significant than historical Monday effect; weakening
- Significance: Observable historically but substantially weaker than in past; less pronounced than Monday effect was

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-11-15 (next Friday)
- Event: Friday trading; weekly options expiration
- Expected Impact: Mild positive bias persists but much weaker than historical data suggests

**Failure Conditions:**
- Settlement advantages no longer exist (T+1 settlement)
- Options expiration Fridays show slight negative bias (-0.02% avg)
- Effect varies based on news cycle and month-end dynamics

**Trading Implications:**
Mild positive bias remains but not strong enough for standalone strategy. Thursday-to-Friday close actually shows WEAKEST day-to-day performance in recent studies. Friday before 3-day weekends shows different pattern. Best use as supplementary information with other factors.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Broader market phenomenon historically; not sector-specific
- Weakest: Options-heavy stocks show different Friday dynamics due to expiration effects

## Rate Hike Cycle

**Category:** Fed Policy
**ID:** fed_hike_cycle
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in hiking cycle
**Period:** Most recent: March 2022 - July 2023 (16 months, 5.25% increase)
**Days Since Last:** 471 (last hike July 2023)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: Positive but highly variable during hikes
- Median Duration: 18 months
- Win Rate: 33% avoid recession (8 of 12 cycles led to recession)
- Sample Size: 12 cycles since 1965 (8 since 1974)
- Std Deviation: High (varies widely by cycle context)
- Best Return: 1994-1995 soft landing (market continued strong)
- Worst Return: 1999-2000 dot-com bust, 1977-1981 deep recession
- Lookback Period: 1974-2023

**Confidence:**
- Score: 75/100
- Level: High
- P-Value: Highly significant pattern of recession risk
- Significance: 67% of hiking cycles culminate in recession; median time to market peak is 22 months from start; yield curve inversions precede 10 of 12 cycles

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: Unknown - depends on future inflation/growth dynamics
- Event: Fed begins raising rates from current 3.75-4.0% level
- Expected Impact: Initial hikes often positive for markets; aggressive hiking eventually leads to correction/recession 67% of time

**Failure Conditions:**
- Soft landing achieved (only 1984 and 1995 precedents)
- Fed reverses course quickly preventing damage
- Fiscal stimulus offsetting monetary tightening

**Trading Implications:**
Early stages often positive as growth remains strong. Favor value stocks, financials, quality, and energy. Reduce growth and high-beta exposure. Average 14.8% gain in 12 months AFTER final hike (8 of 11 periods positive). Markets typically bottom before hiking ends.

**Category:** Fed Policy
**ID:** fed_cut_cycle
**Active:** Yes
**Current Phase:** Active cutting cycle (non-recessionary)
**Period:** September 2024 - present
**Days in Cycle:** 422 (since Sept 17, 2024)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +14.1% in 12 months after first cut
- Median Duration: 26 months per cycle
- Win Rate: 73% positive 12-month returns (8 of 11 cycles)
- Sample Size: 11 cycles since 1974
- Std Deviation: Varies dramatically by economic context
- Best Return: 1995-1996 soft landing, 1998 LTCM response (sharp gains)
- Worst Return: 2007-2008 financial crisis (-56% despite cuts)
- Lookback Period: 1974-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 78/100
- Level: High
- P-Value: Strong historical pattern of positive returns post-first-cut
- Significance: 73% win rate over 12 months; non-recessionary cuts average +20.6% vs recessionary cuts lower; Fed cuts typically AFTER markets peak (4-21 month lag)

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-17 to 2025-12-18 (next FOMC meeting)
- Event: Potential additional 25bp rate cut (to 3.5-3.75%)
- Expected Impact: Continued support for equities; current cycle shows +12% gain after 319 days; typical non-recessionary pattern

**Failure Conditions:**
- Cuts during recession lead to muted returns
- Inflation resurgence forcing Fed to reverse course
- External crisis overwhelming monetary stimulus
- "Fed Put" fails to support markets

**Trading Implications:**
Currently in favorable non-recessionary cut cycle (only 3rd of 11 to avoid recession). Favor technology, growth stocks, consumer discretionary, financials (steeper yield curve), and small-caps. Markets tend to perform well 12+ months after first cut. Quantitative tightening ending Dec 1, 2025 provides additional liquidity support.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Technology (AI-related), Growth stocks, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Small-Caps
- Weakest: Healthcare, Consumer Staples (lower relative returns in growth environments)

---

## Fed Pause Period

**Category:** Fed Policy
**ID:** fed_pause
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Not in pause (currently cutting)
**Period:** Most recent: July 2023 - September 2024 (280 days)
**Days Since Last:** 57

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +6% over 160-day average pause
- Median Duration: 146 days (all pauses); 240 days (long pauses >100 days)
- Win Rate: Strong positive bias especially for longer pauses
- Sample Size: 10 pause periods over 50 years (6 longer pauses since 1989)
- Std Deviation: Moderate
- Best Return: +22.1% (1995-1997 446-day pause and 2006-2007 446-day pause)
- Worst Return: Short pauses show lower average returns
- Lookback Period: 1989-2024

**Confidence:**
- Score: 72/100
- Level: Moderate-High
- P-Value: Long pauses (>100 days) show statistically significant outperformance
- Significance: Clear pattern of stronger returns during longer pauses; 13% average gain for pauses >100 days vs 6% for all pauses

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: Unknown - would occur after current cut cycle ends
- Event: Fed holds rates steady for extended period
- Expected Impact: Historically bullish; longer pauses (+100 days) correlate with ~13% average gains

**Failure Conditions:**
- Brief pause before resuming hikes (bearish scenario)
- Pause during deteriorating economic conditions
- External shocks during pause period

**Trading Implications:**
"Don't fight the Fed" - Pauses after hiking cycles historically very bullish. Favor financials (+15% average), energy (+15% average), technology (strong in long pauses), and quality small-caps. Historical precedent: 1995 pause saw tech lead massively. Next pause cycle likely occurs 2026+ after current cut cycle completes.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Financials (+15%+ avg), Energy (+15%+ avg), Technology (context-dependent), Cyclicals, Quality Small-Caps
- Weakest: Defensives underperform in growth environments during long pauses

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: OpEx Week +0.20% to +0.28% (bullish)
- Median Return: +0.23%
- Win Rate: Positive bias (51.4% for OpEx Friday itself)
- Sample Size: ~361 monthly expirations since 1993 (SPY inception)
- Std Deviation: Not specified but normal for weekly periods
- Best Return: March OpEx weeks historically strongest
- Worst Return: July and January OpEx weeks show negative returns
- Lookback Period: 1993-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 65/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Statistically significant 1990-present (weak pre-1990)
- Significance: OpEx week shows above-average returns (+0.20-0.28% vs ~0.05% random week); effect weakening 2020-2024 due to daily/weekly options proliferation

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-20 (third Friday December)
- Event: Monthly options expire at 4:00 PM ET
- Expected Impact: Bullish bias for the week Monday-Friday; OpEx Friday itself slightly negative (-0.02% avg); pre-OpEx overnight (Thu close to Fri open) strongly positive (+0.09%)

**Failure Conditions:**
- 0DTE (same-day expiration) options now 40%+ of volume, distributing gamma effects
- Wednesday expirations added Nov 2023, further diluting traditional effect
- Major news events overriding seasonal patterns

**Trading Implications:**
Enter positions Monday of OpEx week, hold through Friday. Average weekly return 2-2.8% annualized (invested only 18% of time). Best months: March, August, November. Worst: July, January. Pre-OpEx overnight (Thu close to Fri open) shows strongest single-period effect (+0.09%).

**Sector Performance:**

**Category:** Options Expiration
**ID:** triple_witching
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Between events (last Sept 19)
**Period:** Third Friday of March, June, September, December
**Days Until Next:** 36 (December 19, 2025)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: -0.53% to -0.71% weekly (BEARISH, especially recent years)
- Median Return: Negative recent years
- Win Rate: Less than 30% positive (recent 2021-2024 data)
- Sample Size: ~117 occurrences since inception
- Std Deviation: 3.94% (HIGHER than normal weeks)
- Best Return: March and December more likely positive
- Worst Return: June and September face challenges; September post-TW -0.94% avg (25% win rate)
- Lookback Period: 1974-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 72/100
- Level: Moderate-High
- P-Value: Recent bearish bias statistically significant (2021-2024)
- Significance: Clear recent pattern of weakness; 2021-2024 shows -0.71% avg weekly with only 18% positive Fridays (2 of 11); effect strengthening

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-19
- Event: Simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, index options, and individual stock options
- Expected Impact: Volume surge (+76% vs normal), closing auction volume +365%, extreme volatility 3:00-4:00 PM "witching hour"

**Failure Conditions:**
- March and December historically more favorable (year-end positioning)
- Strong uptrend momentum can override pattern
- Pattern subject to monthly seasonality overlay

**Trading Implications:**
Recent data shows consistent selling pressure during triple witching weeks. Average Friday decline -0.59% (2021-2024). Strategy: reduce exposure before event, wait for post-witching week weakness to scale back in. September triple witching especially weak (post-event week -0.94% average). Volume peaks at 250% normal at 3:30 PM with extreme volatility.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Defensives on relative basis during selloffs
- Weakest: High-beta and momentum stocks vulnerable to volatility spikes

## Pre-OpEx Week

**Category:** Options Expiration
**ID:** pre_opex_week
**Active:** No (just completed)
**Current Phase:** Between OpEx periods
**Period:** Week before monthly options expiration (includes OpEx week)
**Days Until Next:** 36 (Dec 15-20, 2025)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: +0.20% to +0.30% for the week (4-6x random week)
- Median Return: +0.25%
- Win Rate: Positive bias
- Sample Size: ~361 weeks since 1993
- Std Deviation: Lower than non-OpEx weeks due to gamma pinning
- Best Return: Strongest in months with positive seasonal bias (March, August, November)
- Worst Return: September post-OpEx week (-0.94%), February/June also weak post-OpEx
- Lookback Period: 1993-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 70/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Statistically significant post-1990
- Significance: Academic research confirms market maker delta-hedge rebalancing creates bullish effect; S&P 100 stocks show "substantially higher" weekly returns during OpEx weeks

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: 2025-12-15 (Monday of Dec OpEx week)
- Event: Pre-expiration week begins
- Expected Impact: Positive gamma buildup creates "pinning" behavior toward high open-interest strikes; volatility suppression; modest upward drift

**Failure Conditions:**
- Effect weakening due to 0DTE options (40%+ of SPY volume now same-day expiration)
- Daily and weekly expirations distributing traditional monthly effect
- Wednesday expirations (added Nov 2023) further diluting pattern

**Trading Implications:**
Enter Monday of third week, exit Friday close. Average +0.20-0.30% weekly gain vs +0.05% random week. Mechanism: market makers reduce short-stock hedges as options approach expiration, creating buying pressure. Post-OpEx week (fourth Friday week) shows underperformance except August. Gamma pinning strongest final hours before expiration.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Large-cap stocks with high options activity (S&P 100 focus); Technology
- Weakest: Effect minimal in low-options-volume stocks; small/mid-caps less pronounced

**Category:** Earnings
**ID:** earnings_q1
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Outside earnings period
**Period:** Mid-April through end of May (reporting Q1: Jan-Mar results)
**Days Until Next:** 153 (April 2026 start)

**Statistics:**
- Average Return: Variable by year; Q1 2025 estimated +10.1% earnings growth
- Median Return: Market returns during season vary widely
- Win Rate: Beat rate 5-yr avg 77%, 10-yr avg 75%
- Sample Size: 200+ quarters of data (50 years × 4 quarters)
- Std Deviation: Individual stock volatility 4x normal during announcements (2017 data)
- Best Return: Q1 2021 (23.1% earnings surprise, highest in dataset)
- Worst Return: Q1 2022 (earnings surprises began declining, inflation impact)
- Lookback Period: 1974-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 68/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Post-earnings drift statistically significant (p<0.05); abnormal returns 2.6-9% for 60-90 days
- Significance: Well-documented earnings announcement effects; beat rates consistently above 75% (analysts systematically conservative)

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: ~April 15, 2026
- Event: Q1 2026 earnings season begins (reporting Jan-Mar 2026 results)
- Expected Impact: Market volatility increases; individual stocks react strongly to beats/misses; post-earnings drift for beat stocks

**Failure Conditions:**
- Major recession causing widespread misses
- Economic shock during quarter reported
- Valuation compression despite earnings beats

**Trading Implications:**
Financials report first (JPM, C, WFC, BAC). Tech reports mid-to-late season. Companies beating estimates show 0.0% immediate reaction in Q3 2025 (below 5-yr avg +0.9%), but post-earnings drift continues for 60-90 days averaging +2.6-9% abnormal returns. Strategy: buy confirmed beat stocks 1-4 weeks post-announcement to capture drift.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Varies by economic context; historically strong in expansion phases
- Weakest: Sectors facing headwinds show concentrated misses; Q1 2025 estimated earnings growth +10.1%

## Q2 Earnings Season

**Category:** Earnings
**ID:** earnings_q2
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Outside earnings period
**Period:** Mid-July through end of August (reporting Q2: Apr-Jun results)

- Lookback Period: 1974-2025

**Confidence:**
- Score: 68/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Post-earnings drift significant; beat rates consistently high
- Significance: Similar statistical properties to other quarters; summer timing coincides with lower overall market volumes

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: ~July 15, 2026
- Event: Q2 2026 earnings season begins (reporting Apr-Jun 2026 results)
- Expected Impact: Peak earnings weeks late July through early August; overlaps with summer doldrums creating potential volatility

**Failure Conditions:**
- Economic deterioration during spring/summer quarter
- Consumer spending weakness affecting results
- Fed policy surprising markets mid-season

**Trading Implications:**
Timing overlaps with "Sell in May" period and summer doldrums, creating mixed seasonal effects. Financials report first, tech mid-season. Post-earnings drift remains actionable. Q2 2025 estimated growth +10.9%. Strategy: focus on high-conviction earnings winners and hold 4-8 weeks post-announcement.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Technology, Consumer Discretionary if consumer strong
- Weakest: Context-dependent; Q2 2025 shows continued double-digit earnings growth expected

- Win Rate: Q3 2025 beat rate 82% (highest since Q3 2021, above 5-yr avg 77%)
- Sample Size: 200+ quarters; Q3 2025: 455 of 500 companies reported as of Nov 7
- Std Deviation: 4x normal volatility during announcements
- Best Return: Q3 2025 showing 82% beat rate (tied for best since 2021)
- Worst Return: Q3 2022 peak inflation impact

- Future risk: if elevated expectations not met in subsequent quarters

**Trading Implications:**
Currently in late stage of exceptionally strong Q3 2025 season. Key findings: 82% beat rate, Tech +27.1% growth, Financials +23.7% growth. Companies beating show 0.0% immediate price reaction (market demanding more), but misses punished severely (-5.1% vs -2.6% 5-yr avg). Post-earnings drift actionable. Positive guidance (49%) suggests strong Q4 setup.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Information Technology (+27.1% growth, 92% beat rate), Financials (+23.7% growth, 100% bank beat rate), Healthcare (93% beat rate)
- Weakest: Communication Services (-7.1%), Energy (negative growth, oil volatility), Consumer Staples (marginal decline)

## Q4 Earnings Season

**Category:** Earnings
**ID:** earnings_q4
**Active:** No
**Current Phase:** Approaching (reports in Jan-Feb 2026)
**Period:** Mid-January through end of February (reporting Q4: Oct-Dec results)
**Days Until Start:** 64 (January 2026)

- Score: 70/100
- Level: Moderate
- P-Value: Post-earnings drift remains significant
- Significance: Q4 critical for full-year guidance; coincides with January Barometer and Santa Rally periods creating multiple overlapping effects

**Next Trigger:**
- Date: ~January 15, 2026
- Event: Q4 2025 earnings season begins (reporting Oct-Dec 2025 results)
- Expected Impact: Financials report first; full-year 2025 results and 2026 guidance set tone for year; January Barometer correlation 77%

**Failure Conditions:**
- Weak holiday season sales disappointing consumer-facing sectors
- Guidance cuts for upcoming year
- Economic deterioration in Q4 2025

**Trading Implications:**
Q4 earnings reporting coincides with Santa Claus Rally (Dec 24-Jan 3) and January Effect creating complex seasonal dynamics. Expected Q4 2025 growth +7.5% (lower than recent quarters). Forward P/E elevated at 22.0-22.7 (vs 5-yr avg 19.8), suggesting high expectations. Strategy: focus on full-year guidance quality; post-earnings drift remains actionable.

**Sector Performance:**
- Strongest: Financials report first and set tone; Technology guidance critical for market direction; 2025 estimated: Mag 7 growth +20.7%
- Weakest: Sectors facing margin pressure or weakening demand; monitor consumer health in retail earnings
